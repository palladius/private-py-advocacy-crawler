It explores two solutions: field promotion and salting. Field promotion involves moving fields from the column data into the row key to distribute writes, while salting adds a calculated element to the row key for similar distribution. The author suggests field promotion as a better solution for Timesliders, a mobile-application performance library. They also mention OpenTSDB as a third-party library for handling time series data in Bigtable.",

It highlights the case of Urban Fitness Forge, a real-time fitness tracker company, which faced performance issues due to their naive use of latitude/longitude values in their row key. The article explains how their query pattern, combined with Bigtable's lexicographical sorting, resulted in full table scans, impacting performance. The author proposes using a space-filling curve, like the Hilbert curve, to modify the index and ensure that geographically close entities are also close in the table space, reducing scan size. He emphasizes that understanding data usage patterns and choosing the right row key is crucial for achieving good performance in Bigtable.",

It explains that Datastore contention arises from concurrent requests to update the same entity or entity group. The author presents sharding as the optimal solution for mitigating contention, where multiple copies of an entity are created and updated randomly, reducing load on a single entity. The article illustrates the performance improvement through a load test comparing a single entity counter with a sharded version, demonstrating a significant decrease in execution time. It suggests that sharding is an effective strategy for handling high update rates on Datastore.",

The author explains how Bigtable's sharding mechanism, combined with lexicographically ordered keys, leads to workload concentration on a limited number of tablets.  He demonstrates how this contention can negatively impact read performance through a load test, showing a significant increase in execution time when the QPS reaches a certain threshold. The article suggests prepending a random hash to keys to distribute them across multiple tablets as a solution.  However, it emphasizes that this solution can complicate queries and should be used only when encountering this specific issue.",
