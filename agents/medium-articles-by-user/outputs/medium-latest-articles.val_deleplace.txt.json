It discusses the potential memory leak that occurred in Go 1.21 due to uncollected pointers after deletion, and how the author proposed and implemented a fix for this issue in Go 1.22. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the in-place modification behavior of `slices.Delete` and the consequences of ignoring its return value. The article concludes by underscoring the value of writing code that is frugal with memory and minimizes the risk of Out of Memory errors in cloud applications.",

The author explains that while each bool value only requires a single bit of storage, due to the byte-oriented memory addressing in Go, each bool actually occupies an entire byte, resulting in an 8x overhead. The article highlights the inefficiency of using a simple bool slice for storing large sets of boolean values and suggests exploring more compact alternatives like bitsets for optimizing memory consumption.",
