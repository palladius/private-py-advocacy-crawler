It highlights the challenges of managing serverless applications with a large number of functions and their composition. The article emphasizes the importance of observability and architecture assessment for serverless systems. OWVIS uses a 3D map metaphor to visualize functions, their metrics, and dependencies. It provides various visualization templates (scenarios) to analyze different aspects of the architecture, such as function oversizing and caching suggestions. The article also outlines the system architecture of OWVIS, its modular design, and deployment options (Docker, Docker-Compose, Kubernetes). Finally, it discusses limitations, such as the need for manual data aggregation, and the impact of OpenWhisk API limitations on large-scale deployments. OWVIS is a valuable tool for improving FaaS development and observability, particularly for identifying potential cost improvements and architectural optimization opportunities.",

It delves into the platform’s event-driven programming model, outlining key entities like triggers, rules, actions, namespaces, and packages. The article explains how actions can be implemented in various programming languages (Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Swift, .Net) and how Docker containers can be used to run actions with any language. It then explores the platform architecture, highlighting components like NginX, the Controller, CouchDB, the Invoker, and Kafka. The article emphasizes the importance of runtime data for observability and debugging. It describes the structure and content of activation records, which hold valuable information about function execution, including duration, status codes, logs, and performance metrics. The article also discusses limitations in the available runtime data and proposes function instrumentation as a solution to enrich it. It showcases an open-source framework, openwhisk-instrumentation, for instrumenting Node.js actions to collect additional metrics.",

It defines serverless architectures as those built primarily on functions hosted on FaaS platforms and supplemented by BaaS services. The article highlights key characteristics of serverless architectures, such as event-driven nature, stateless services, asynchronous function calls, and pay-per-use pricing model. It discusses the trade-offs between fine service granularity and cold start behavior. The article then explores various serverless architecture patterns, including function warmer, oversize functions, router, aggregator, function chain, fan-out and fan-in, externalized state, and read-heavy reporting engine. It explains the rationale behind each pattern, its advantages, and potential disadvantages. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of observability and visualization tools, such as the OpenWhisk Visualizer (OWVIS), to manage the complexity of serverless architectures.",
