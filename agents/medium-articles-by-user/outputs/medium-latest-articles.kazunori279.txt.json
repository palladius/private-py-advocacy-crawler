            "summary": "This article details building a sound recognition gadget using Raspberry Pi (RasPi) and Google Cloud AutoML Vision. It starts with collecting sound samples from various sources in the living room (e.g., doorbell, microwave, voices) and processing them into spectrograms.  These spectrograms are then uploaded to AutoML Vision for training, which automatically builds a model to recognize different sounds. The article describes the process of setting up RasPi for audio recording, using sox for audio manipulation and data augmentation, generating spectrograms, and finally, using AutoML Vision to train the model. It goes into detail about the accuracy of the model, latency, and cost of using AutoML Vision for real-time sound recognition. The author highlights the ease of use and high accuracy offered by AutoML Vision, making it accessible even for those without extensive machine learning expertise.",

The author uses the obniz board's UART API to control the fingerprint scanner, enabling it to register fingerprints and perform authentication. When a match is found, a webhook call is sent to IFTTT, which triggers a Switchbot to press the Qrio Lock's physical key, unlocking the door.  The article outlines the process of connecting the fingerprint scanner to obniz, creating a web interface for managing fingerprints, and integrating IFTTT to control the Qrio Lock. It discusses the pros and cons of this approach, emphasizing the convenience of hands-free unlocking while acknowledging the potential for delays and limitations in the technology.",

The first clock displays current weather information obtained from the Dark Sky API via a jQuery ajax call. It parses the JSON response and displays weather data and icons on an OLED display. The second clock uses an Adafruit LED ring to represent weather conditions with different colors. Red indicates the hour hand, and other colors, such as blue for high precipitation probability and green for low cloud cover, represent the weather. The author details the process of connecting the LED ring to obniz, using LED drivers, and creating smooth transitions for the hands of the clock.  He concludes by describing how a brightness sensor and a photo frame enhance the final product.",

The author uses an accelerometer attached to the obniz to record motion data during various simulated baby soothing techniques, like rocking, being held, and being tossed. This data is then fed into a TensorFlow.js model to train it to recognize different motion patterns associated with calming a baby. The article discusses the use of a 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for pattern recognition in the accelerometer data and emphasizes the ease of use and efficiency of TensorFlow.js for machine learning tasks. It ends with a humorous demonstration of the model's ability to identify and simulate different soothing methods.",
