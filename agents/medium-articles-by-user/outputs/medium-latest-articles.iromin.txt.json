The author describes the challenges of integrating foundation models with real-world data and how function calling offers a solution by allowing models to interact with external tools or APIs. The article provides a practical example using an inventory API and sample prompts to illustrate how the model can interpret user requests and invoke relevant functions. It further explores how the model determines which function to call and whether it will automatically invoke it or require user intervention. The article emphasizes the use of Java language for code samples and provides a link to a GitHub repository for further exploration.",
