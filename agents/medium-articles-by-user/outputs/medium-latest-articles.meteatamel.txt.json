The test involves asking the LLM to find the correct answer from a list of shuffled options. The author then compares the LLM's responses to the verified answers in the dataset, measuring the accuracy. While the test is not scientifically rigorous, it provides a practical way to gauge an LLM's trustworthiness.",
