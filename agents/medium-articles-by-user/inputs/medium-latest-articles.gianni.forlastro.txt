DevFest Italy: CFP concluded … successfully!(Per questo articolo in Italiano, premi qui)A few days ago I started talking about DevFest Italia 2020, and the importance that this will have on the overview of online conferences.COVID has profoundly changed the organization and use of conferences: many immediately poured onto online platforms which, in recent months, have grown a lot and have kept the general level high.Among these was the DevParty Together, that took place in May, which involved many Italian GDGs in two days of conferences on various topics (I leave you the link here to retrieve the recordings).As anticipated at the beginning of the article, we are working for the DevFest Italy 2020, where the Call For Papers has just ended: the event will be “global” and the CFP launched by the Italian community has risen to the situation.The organization received 93 requests for talks: first of all we can only thank all those who have spent a few minutes of their free time to submit their candidacy in our bet.Here are some statistics on the progress of the sending of proposals from its opening, 8 September, to its closing, 30 September.The trend was constant, with a substantial increase during the last few days before closing.Most of the submissions came from the Italian community, with 30% of submissions in English. This figure stands exactly on our prevision of an international conference in two languages in the measure of 70% Italian / 30% English.Furthermore, half of the proposals are totally unpublished: we will therefore have high-level and totally original talks.The last interesting fact to observe is the area for sending proposals:where:Green: Mobile, 26 submitted proposalBlue: Soft Skills, 21 submitted proposalPink: Cloud, 18 submitted proposalRed: Frontend, 17 submitted proposalYellow: “Other” (transversal), 16 submitted proposalOrange: Diversity &amp; Inclusion, 11 submitted proposalLilac: Machine Learning, 11 submitted proposalPurple: Marketing, 10 submitted proposalsTotal is obviously more than 93, but some are part of multiple areas and count for both.But be careful: the positions available for the talks will be about half so, reluctantly, we will not be able to accept all of them.We ask all those who have submitted their proposal to wait for the scientific committee to carefully evaluate everything in order to draw up the final lineup.I remember that on the same weekend of DevFest Italy, there will be another 14 European DevFests at the same time (Russia, Greece &amp; Cyprus, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Ukraine, Denmark, Poland, Romania, Portugal, UK &amp; Ireland, Hungary) where many GDE, Googler and professionals will take turns on their respective virtual stages.So, the party has yet to begin!

(Per questo articolo in Italiano, premi qui)To say it is not only the title of this post, but the format chosen by the GDG Communities.Before telling you everything, let’s take a small step back to learn more about this “mini-world” created by the Google Developer Group, local communities populated by developers and technology enthusiasts.What are DevFests?DevFests, historically, are great events conceived and organized by local GDG communities, for fans of the world of technology (but not only!) Who want to share and deepen their skills and knowledge while having fun with a community spirit.This year, due to COVID, the global GDG world has mobilized to create a weekend of contemporary DevFests, devising a two-day format of talks entirely online, which could reflect what we usually organize during the year.Russia, Greece &amp; Cyprus, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Ukraine, Denmark, Poland, Romania, Portugal, UK &amp; Ireland, Hungary: these are the 15 European DevFests which, at the same time, will host various professionals and enthusiasts on stage.What will happen during the DevFest Italy? Obviously I can’t reveal anything yet, the organizing team got underway just over a month ago and the two-day conference is taking shape.The areas on which we have opened the Call For Papers are:- Cloud Computing- Frontend- Machine Learning- Marketing- Mobile- Diversity &amp; Inclusion- Soft SkillsWe will have well-known speakers on the Italian scene … but not only! The whole organization, in fact, unanimously voted to offer the entire Italian community the possibility of hosting foreign speakers and therefore having content in English.And I assure you that they will be two unmissable days!Can’t resist and want to know more? Okay, I’ll be good. Here is a brief overview of the first confirmed speakers that we’ll begin to know better in the coming days.Who am I talking about?They are only the first great speakers who will take the virtual stage of the first DevFest Italia on 17 and 18 October!After all this, are you still not sure you want to participate? Michel Murabito, a great and very popular community expert, tells us, in this short video, why to follow DevFest Italia.https://medium.com/media/8a049b1a5b3d9320179472cdb124d6e5/hrefEnjoy!

(Leggi qui questo articolo in Italiano)When I was offered the position of Community Manager of the GDG Cloud Turin, back in October 2018, I was immediately contacted by Antonella, who offered to help me if necessary. I have always found her very helpful and full of excellent proposals: I therefore wanted to have a chat with her, who has an incredible background on cloud computing.In fact, his short bio quotes “I am a manager/entrepreneur, but I have always remained technical and I have an experience that goes from Mainframes to the Cloud. Without tedious lists of skills, the most beautiful thing that I find myself, certainly not for my merit, is the ability to proactively interact with smart people of any age and the same enthusiasm and projection towards the future that I had at 20. I have to thank mom, my work and the environment of the Communities for this“.Hi Antonella! you are a Cloud GDE: what does it mean?Nice question and I would like to answer you in two ways. Meanwhile, a GDE is an expert in a Google subject who, in a totally independent way (how and when he wants), carries out dissemination activities on his expertise. Google technologies but not only. Refunded, not paid. The second answer I would like to give you is personal: the initial motivation was to do more for talented young people, especially women. I state that I am not a feminist. But it is now proven that, by nature and by education, women stand out less than men professionally. Sometimes girls with talent need to be helped and supported. By those who are capable of sharing the same thoughts and emotions.You have many certifications to your credit: from “Associate Cloud Engineer” to Professional, “Cloud Developer”, “Data Engineering” and “Cloud Architect”. Compliments! Which of these, in your opinion, is the most complicated to achieve? Thanks, and they are also AWS and Azure certified. They are all very similar, and all rather theoretical. At this stage of my career I do enough training. I have always loved teaching since when I was teaching at the university. And the best method, for me, is to get off the chair. So this step was necessary. I must say, after the initial confusion and boredom, I find the preparation and conduct of the exams very amusing. I wrote a couple of articles on the subject.Here are the links for a reading: - Google Cloud Certifications: Study and PASS any Exams- MS Azure Architect Certification with fun: for AWS and GCP expertsLet’s talk about the “Cloud Developer” certification, which could be of greater help to many developers: what topics deepens? How can the overall vision of a medium / large project change with the skills acquired with this certification? All certifications share at least 50% of the topics. And they are almost all quite theoretical. Experts turn up their noses because they say that a certified person is not necessarily an expert. This is true. But when he has to do something practical he knows how to get his hands and how to get informed.It is a protection for those who pay for services. That’s all.The developer also has the concepts (but not the code) of programming and something of SQL (which everyone, rightly, must know). Less a bit of Network.The main skills that are acquired are:- Cloud and related services- How to create or make apps scalable- Organization of the development project (CI / CD, Containers etc.)- How to develop with less code- So knowing the Cloud is truly a great way to become a better IT professional.Can you give an example of one of the modules listed in that certification? To prepare for the exam, the Official Guide is this: Official Study Guide. If you want a simpler and more immediate reading key, you need to:-Get an idea of all GCP platforms and products-Understand well how do you design and deploy a scalable app-Know the concepts of Kubernetes well-Be familiar with SQL-Understand the basic concepts of Security, Monitoring and Alerting-Last but not least, ML basics. At Google does not run away from machine learning.How much it can help, at a working level, to have achieved a Google Cloud certification? Abroad, find work immediately or improve your level. In Italy a little less, but the Google Cloud is having great success, even in mixed environments. Google has particularly advanced services.Quite obvious: after all, Google is the most innovative software company that has ever existed that does not sell software (but various services). My opinion, but I don’t think I’m wrong. With all the advantages and disadvantages of the case. To return to the question, it is also a medium-term investment.In Rome, you are organizing a course to help professionals discover and achieve a Google Cloud certification: tell us about the format and what do you have in mind? Will it be a free and limited-entry event? Of course, but be careful: it won’t be only in Rome, because it’s international! Remote, delivered with Google Classroom and designed to be both remote and live. Currently only remote, thanks to COVID-19. Flexible, because you can deal with your ideal study method.Here I explain how: Learn and change in YOUR WAY.We are currently testing it, first with the Italian Google Communities, then with the European ones. The course for everyone will start in early April, completely free. The general description of the course and the contents, with the code and the instructions to enroll are here on Medium: Course for Professional Cloud Developer Certification.Thank you so much for all the valuable information you have given us. To greet us, what advice do you give to anyone wishing to undertake this path of obtaining a certification? Improve your study method and above all find the way that suits you best and have fun. Acquiring skills is one of the most exciting things in life. You become more confident, combative and aware of being able to be of greater help to those who are close to you and to whom you love.My article is a little help but on the web you find a whole world.Contact the Google Community Leader closest to you: here is the official website. You will receive help, material and support.

GDG DevParty — Core Team(Per questo articolo in Italiano, premi qui)In the past seventy days, the entire nation has faced one of the biggest health emergencies since the first post-war period.After a first moment of general displacement due to the stringent measures with which the Italian government has implemented to deal with the emergency, the GDG Communities have also organized themselves.And they restarted, moving all their activities from on-site to online.In fact, in recent months, unless there are proven work or health needs, all movements have been prohibited and all events, of any nature, have been postponed or canceled.This freezing of activities, however, has allowed us to totally break down the barrier of distance: “Neighbors, although distant” is the slogan that accompanied us in reading the newspapers or during television commercials.The Community of GDG Italia wanted to implement it, in its own way, by organizing the first major conference ever set up before.And totally online.From programming to the two days of the conference, there were no organizers or speakers who met in person.A Community Leader task force was therefore created from the following GDGs: GDG Bari, GDG Campobasso, GDG Cosenza, GDG Firenze, DSC Firenze, GDG Nebrodi, GDG Pescara, GDG Pisa, GDG Roma, GDG Torino, GDG Cloud Torino, GDG Trento, and with the participation of WTM Italia.Thanks to excellent coordination based on common sense and democratic voting, the first two activities on which the whole group worked were:- Group subdivision into subgroups: communication, content, community-engagement, follow-up and infrastructure- Creation of the name of the conference, which could reflect the unity of the communities despite the distance, but also the spirit that unites all the GDGs: here, as if by magic and out of nowhere, the brand “DevParty Together”- The topics to be discussed during the conference, the dates and the main language to be usedSince then, each subgroup has moved independently, reporting their progress in weekly plenary meetings.The time available to organize the conference was short but intense — about 1 month — and all the organizers really gave 110% during the organizational period.The weeks passed quickly and gradually the puzzle of the various activities was composed in a single drawing: the two days of live event.The first GDG DevParty came to life on 2 and 3 May: directors, presenters and moderators were present at their workstations, ready to give their best and offer a level conference to the entire Italian community.Over 35 sessions divided into 2 afternoons, 6 tracks, 3 of which parallel with topics such as Cloud Computing, Frontend, Mobile, Machine Learning, Soft Skills and Diversity &amp; Inclusion.The stage saw the succession of high-level speakers who showed us technicalities, gave us smiles and shared their fears and weaknesses with us.With a rigorously respected timing, thanks to the direction and the speakers (who managed their available time well) everything went as expected.Indeed, no. Better than expected.The participants responded en masse to this most unique and rare occasion: with an audience of over 1300, with peaks of around 500 on some tracks, the listeners actively interacted with questions to the speakers.Overall, the conference has always maintained an average of 600 views, divided on three tracks.I can only thank all the organizers who, like me, have done their utmost to really propose a high-level conference.And thanks also go to the stars of the two days spent together, the speakers, who immediately believed in the “DevParty project”, a conference at the first edition and totally unknown, which turned out to be a success.All this, and much more, was the first major Italian GDG DevParty Together.And I’m proud to be able to say not the classic “I was there”, but rather “I lived it fully”.In the next article we will see in detail the activities carried out by each working group, so that it can be a useful track for all communities wishing to organize a successful online conference, without being afraid of forgetting anything.Made With Love.
