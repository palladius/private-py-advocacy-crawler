Companies that want to succeed in the ever-changing world of exponentially growing data need to secure access to the best data engineering talent on the market. Employees, on the other hand, need to constantly up their game to be competitive with skills, expertise and the latest tools.Read along if you’d like to learn how one of our partners built a program to train and up-skill the next generation of data engineers, and get some insights around the recruitment process, curriculum and teaching methods used. Moreover you’ll explore the direct feedback from the participants who valued this experience.I hope you too can find a similar program in the future to boost your career.Program for aspiring Data EngineersAccenture Poland, a Google Cloud Partner, and the local Google Cloud DevRel team, recently concluded the first edition of “Google Cloud Starter Academy in Data&amp;AI”. It was an intensive 3-week program designed to empower students with the knowledge and skills to excel in data engineering careers.Focused on future data starsThis initiative aimed to equip students with the expertise needed to navigate the world of data engineering and cloud computing. By leveraging Google Cloud tools and technologies, the program equipped participants to construct and manage data pipelines.Where talent meets opportunityThe recruitment process was highly competitive, with over 450 resumes submitted for consideration. From this impressive pool of candidates, over 20 participants were meticulously selected to participate in the Academy.Moreover the program welcomed students from diverse backgrounds, with a particular focus on those pursuing degrees in computer science, information technology, or related fields. Their eagerness to explore data engineering and cloud computing made them ideal candidates for this program.A curriculum packed with valuable knowledgeThroughout the program, students delved into:The core principles and practices of data engineeringThe functionalities of Google Cloud’’s suite of tools and technologiesThe process of building and managing data pipelinesThe power of Google AI tools to enhance the data engineering processThe program covered many Google Cloud products including Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery (BigLake Tables, Objects Tables, External tables and Run federated queries), Looker, Cloud SQL, Firestore, Dataproc, Dataflow, Dataform, Cloud Composer, Pub/Sub, Eventarc, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Workflows and Dataplex (Manage Lakes, Data Profiles and Data Quality).A blended learning experienceThe program offered a well-rounded learning experience, combining theoretical and practical components. Online lectures allowed students to grasp key concepts during evening sessions. Meanwhile, hands-on labs and workshops led by experienced Accenture instructors provided practical application of the learned knowledge.To cap the experience off, students delivered their final projects and presented them to each other and industry professionals at a day-long gathering in the office connected with graduation celebrations.As emphasised by Marta Matysiak, leading Google Cloud — Accenture Alliance in Poland — “Accenture is perfectly suited to lead these initiatives and empower the next generation of engineers in today’s dynamic IT landscape. Their experience as a global Google Cloud Partner, combined with their own innovative engineering work, means they can offer invaluable knowledge to the future workforce. We’re excited about this collaborative effort.”Outcomes that surpassed expectations“We are truly convinced that such initiatives are well positioned to build talents and peer networks. They also provide a friendly, comfortable space for a smooth transition from theoretical knowledge to using skills in practice. The level of curiosity, openness and engagement of this particular group was really impressive — the new generation of Google Cloud practitioners is already there.” — Bartosz Średniak, Accenture Google Business Group Poland Lead.The Google Cloud Starter Academy in Data&amp;AI proved to be a resounding success. Students benefited from:Insights gleaned from seasoned data engineersPractical experience working with Google Cloud’s powerful toolsOpportunities to connect with fellow students and industry professionalsRecognition of their achievements through a program completion certificateMoreover the top students have been offered a permanent job at Accenture. Congratulations 🎉The legacy of the AcademyThe Google Cloud Starter Academy in Data&amp;AI serves as a testament to the power of collaboration in fostering the next generation of data engineering talent. The 3-week program, held in the evenings for maximum accessibility, provided students with a springboard for their data-driven careers.Upon completion of the Academy, participants shared valuable feedback about their experiences. Here are a couple of their key insights:“Participating in this school was an extremely valuable experience for me. The lesson plan was perfectly balanced, ensuring a good split between theory and practice. I would especially like to emphasize the exceptional quality of the staff, especially Grzesiek and Alicja, who shared not only their vast knowledge, but also fascinating facts related to the industry, which allowed us to understand the topic from the inside.Of course, apart from their enormous knowledge, they are extremely charismatic and helpful people, which made me feel really comfortable throughout the entire school.The classes were not only interesting, but also challenging, which motivated me to spend more time on the topics discussed. The same was true for the final design.If there is such an opportunity in the future, I wholeheartedly recommend this school to everyone :)” — Mikołaj“Despite the challenge of a limited time of three weeks, we received a large dose of knowledge that will certainly be useful in our further development and work. The school was run by experienced data engineering enthusiasts who were happy to share their knowledge. If there are further editions, I recommend it to everyone!” — Bartosz“The Google Cloud Academy from Accenture was an amazing adventure with people who show passion, knowledge, commitment, as well as a great atmosphere and attitude. Thanks to them, I expanded my knowledge in the field of Data &amp; AI and met a lot of new interesting people. I can recommend everyone to take part in the Academy, even if you are not a beginner, because working with the Accenture team allows you to learn many new, interesting things.” — Matthew“The Google Cloud Starter Academy in Data&amp;AI was a very valuable experience for me. The most valuable things for me were the laboratories and carefully prepared homework assignments for those interested. Even though the tasks were time consuming, they gave great satisfaction and a sense of understanding of individual Google Cloud tools. I am grateful to all the people running the school for their great commitment, time spent with us and willingness to share their knowledge and experience.
