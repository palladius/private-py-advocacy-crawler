The ultimate guide to Alaska in winterNorthern lights &amp; winter activities in AlaskaOur first trip to Alaska was in summer and we found it so beautiful that we wanted to also visit in Winter and take all the beauty in. There is a lot to see and do in the winter ❄️ in Alaska. If Aurora borealis / northern lights is on your list then Alaska is definitely worth a visit in winter. You can enjoy the beautiful white snowy landscape for miles and apart from that if you are like us, crossing the Arctic circle is also on your list and Alaska is one of of the 4 places on the globe where you can cross the article circle.Having said that you have to plan better because winter days in Alaska are short with only about 3–5 hours of sunlight depending on the month you go in. I did a bunch of research to plan this trip and this article is to share with you that research to help you plan your Alaskan winter adventure.Let me start with a summary of the trip. Our winter adventure was 9 days including travel time but you can do all the activities I describe here in about 7 days. Keep reading for more details:Day 1: Reach AnchorageWe flew in. You could also directly fly to Fairbanks. We wanted to take the winter train from Anchorage that only runs on Saturday so we decided to fly to Anchorage to take the train next morning.Day 2: Winter train from Anchorage to Fairbanks.This is roughly a 12 hour route starting from Anchorage at 8:30am in the morning and reaching Fairbanks at 8pm. This is spectacular, you see lots of snow and frozen lakes, rivers along the way. The landscape is beautiful almost entire route. It has a pantry coach which serves breakfast lunch and dinner. When you get on the train you can sign up to eat. The service is pretty slow so I would eat breakfast and dinner with some bistro items during the day. You can choose to get all the meals if you like. The train makes a few stops depending on the time of the year and you get the opportunity to go out and take some pictures.Alaska winter train from Anchorage to FairbanksThis train also operates from Fairbanks to Anchorage on Sunday. Like I mentioned earlier, if it more convenient for you to fly into Fairbanks and then take the train to Anchorage at the end of the trip, that would work great too. I would advice doing it in the beginning though because you get really tired of the cold by the end of the trip and the train ride is a lot more fun as the first thing to do in your trip. It’s a different kind of excitement. Any way you choose to do it will work just fine.Breakfast in the train with a beautiful view outside.Most hotels will pick you up from the train station and airport, check with the hotel before you plan. You can also take Uber/Lyft but they are hard to get and take a longer time to arrive, so account for that.Day 3: Arctic circle and Aurora tour in the ArcticWe used Nothern Alaska tour company to book a 2 day tour with them called Aurora overnight tour. This includes the Arctic circle, Dalton highway sign, Alaska trans Atlantic pipeline. We started at 9:15 am at the Northern Alaska tour company where we checked in. Most hotels provide transit to Northern Alaska tour company. From there a coach and a driver was assigned for the tour and we started out at around 9:45am. The first stop was the Lemonade stand where. The second stop was the pipeline where we got to see the pipeline up close, took some pictures with it.Trans-Alaska Pipeline is an oil transportation system spanning AlaskaThe third stop was Dalton highway sign where we were able to take some pictures of the only highway in the north that goes up to the Arctic.Dalton Highway sign on the way to Arctic CircleThen fourth stop was the Yukon river, we were able to see it frozen, it looks beautiful. The stop is a camp with a tiny restaurant and coffee shop but the day we were there it was closed for food. We could grab coffee though.While driving to the Arctic circle there was an area in the trip that our guide called enchanted forest. It literally looked like an enchanted forest, fully white, trees looks like big giants with a huge coat of snow on them. It is something I have never seen before.Enchanted forest, somewhere on the Dalton Highway where we could survive literally 30 seconds outside of the coach.Then the last stop on the trip was Arctic circle sign. I was very excited for this because only 2% of the world population has crossed the Arctic circle and I can now say that I am one of them 😊 If you are a nerd like me, you have to include this in your trip.Arctic Circle, the dividing line between the Northern Temperate zone, to the south, and the Arctic to the north.Since we did a 2 nights Aurora overnight tour, at this stop we had a transfer, Coldfoot camp 🏕 staff came to pick us up and drove us about 1 hour further north on the Dalton Highway to Coldfoot camp which was going to be our home for the next 2 nights.If you only did a day tour then you turn around and drive back to Fairbanks in the same coach. There are options — we did 2 nights Aurora overnight, you could just do one night overnight and do Aurora viewing after reaching Coldfoot the same day. We did 2 nights to increase the chances of catching the lights. Coldfoot is a great spot to see the lights from, it is almost guaranteed that you will see the Northern lights here.Once we reached Coldfoot at around 6 pm our Coldfoot guides asked us to meet at 11pm for Aurora viewing. We did an additional tour where they took us to a nearby village at Wiseman, away from the camp lights to see the lights. They also had a heated camp there with an outdoor wood heater to see the lights comfortably in freezing cold. Trust me these things are important and they made the viewing experience better. It is really cold and not fun to wait around outside.Aurora viewing from Wiseman village near Coldfoot campOne more thing about this — You could do this trip on your own, it takes around 6 hours from Fairbanks to Coldfoot. You can book additional activities are coldfoot when you get there or prior. We just chose to do it with a tour because the drive from Fairbanks to Coldfoot is not that easy, the road is icy in a lot of patches and since we were on vacation we wanted to spend more time enjoying the views than worrying about skidding.Day 4: Coldfoot Camp — Arctic mountain safari and Aroura viewingAt Coldfoot camp they have got a lot of activities that you can book. We took the Arctic mountain safari that takes you further up north on the Dalton highway up to the Atigun pass. It is a high mountain pass across the Brooks Range in Alaska and is the highest pass in Alaska that is maintained throughout the year.Top of the Atigun pass, extremely windy yet magical spot with everything covered in snow.This was a 6 hour drive, back and forth which included some walking on the frozen Dietrich river, locating mountains, spotting wildlife, — we saw a few caribou’s. All in all it was a good use of 6 hours driving more north into the Arctic and see the harsh conditions on the pass.Later that day we just watched Aurora on our own right outside the camp.Day 5: Snowshoeing at Coldfoot campWe booked a snowshoeing tour which Involved a small drive to a trail head and then snowshoeing adventure began for about 2 hours. We walked through the gorgeous and serene white forest covered in snow and beautiful snow covered mountains in the background. This was a treat both because it was a nice and short activity and snowshoeing was fun! Even if you have done snowshoeing before the landscape in this area is gorgeous so I would recommend planning to do this if possible.Snowshoeing at Coldfoot camp, AlaskaThen there was time to leave Coldfoot in the afternoon. The trip back was in a small 7 seater plane from Coldfoot airport (right beside the Coldfoot camp) to the Fairbanks airport. It is a short 45 mins flight with beautiful views of the Yukon rivers, brooks mountain range and the Yukon swamp that looks gorgeous with 1000’s of frozen ponds from the top. We reached Fairbanks around 5pm and stayed the night warm and dry in the hotel.Tiny flight from Coldfood camp to Faibanks, AlaskaDay 6: Chena hot springs northern lights package, hot springs, ice museumChena hot springs are about an hour from Fairbanks, we booked a package with them directly on their website that included Aurora viewing. Again the idea is to get as many chances to see northern lights because we were very focused on maximizing our opportunity to see the lights.Chena hot spring as the suggests is well known for their hot springs, if you have not been to a hot spring before, this is definitely worth checking out. Our package included pickup and drop off from the hotel in Fairbanks. We started at 3pm and were dropped off at 3am. At the same price you could be picked up sooner such as 11am or 1 pm and dropped off at 3am.After reaching we had time to grab dinner at the restaurant. The ice museum tour was at 7pm which took us into the ice museum and we had a drink there in an ice glass. Got to break the glass after the drink which was fun.Ice Museum, Chena Hot SpringsWe hit the hot springs after that, the hot springs themselves were really good, 102 F inside and — 20 outside. Our hair had frozen and it was a great experience to see that phenomenon happen. By the time we reached it was already dark, if you are doing a day tour, they have earlier options for you to be picked up at 9am, 11am or 1pm. I would say, pick an earlier option because the hot spring pools would be probably more enjoyable for pictures if there is more day light. Warning: If you are a cleanliness freak like me, it will be hard for you to enjoy this because the shower and changing area to get into the pools is not very well kept.The last activity at Chena resort was the Aurora viewing at 9:30pm. Their Aurora tour is great, they take you up a mountain on a 45 Mins ride in a military tank looking thing with the chains for wash grip on the snow and ice up the mountain. Up there they have a heated yurt with some hot drinks to keep you warm while you wait for the lights. The day we went, the Northern lights were visible the entire time, it was spectacular.Northern Lights from Chena Hot Springs Aurora tourTip: I would not stay at Chena hot spring resort, just drive up on your own from Fairbanks or book the day tour like we did. The resort rooms are not good and they lack basic things such as hot water and cleanliness. The activities I described are really all you need to checkout which can be done in a day trip without staying.Day 7: SnowmobileWe reserved a day for snowmobile at Rod’s Alaskan Guide Service. We had a rental car on this day and drove there from Fairbanks. It’s about 20 mins drive. If you have not done Snowmobile before, this was a good activity which we really enjoyed. The beauty of doing it with this company is that their snowmobiles have heated handles, they provide all the gear that is needed. Helmet was also clean and tidy.Snowmobile in Fairbanks Alaska, Rod’s Akaskan Guide ServiceDay 8: Dog Sledging &amp; North poleDog sledging was on my list to do. We had a morning sled and was very fun! We booked this through Rod’s Alaskan Guide Service. They give you the outer layer to protect you from cold and the dogs were amazing. We got to pet a few :)Dog Sledging at Rod’s Alaskan Guide ServiceAfter dog sledging we went to North Pole, Santa Claus house, it’s a gift shot just 10 mins from Rods adventure so we ended up checking it out. I think it was underwhelming because it’s really just a gift shop with an opportunity to take pictures with Santa Claus. I suggest skipping it if you don’t have time.Then we drive back to Fairbanks and spend an hour at the museum of the north. It was nice to look at the animals from the north. If you have the time, check it out.Museum of the north, Fairbanks AlaskaTip to save days/time: You could compile days 7 and 8 to do snowmobile and dog sledging on the same day. This will save you a day and you can still do the museum and North Pole on the same day. We could not find the spots to do both the same day so we did separate days, also we needed a bit of a break from the cold to enjoy those two things on separate days.Day 9: Fly back homeIf you want you can take the train back to Anchorage if you did not do that on your way in. I would not recommend doing this twice. Just once gives you all that you need to take in.What to packThis could be its own blog but I am going to share briefly how we planned and prepared for the trip.Clothes- you will be outside in subzero temperatures for a long time watching Aurora and doing other activities, make sure to pack accordingly. Invest in good quality Gloves, beanie, mittens, snow pants, parka jackets, snow shoes.Pack lots of layers — a base layer, t-shirt, full sleeve shirt, light jacket and overcoat will be needed most of the days.Hot hands — carry some hot hands with you to recover your hands and feet from cold.ConclusionWe absolutely enjoyed our time in Alaska during this winter trip. As I mentioned above, if you have limited time, you can do all these things I mentioned in about 6–7 days. But, since most of the Aurora viewing days end around 4am give yourself some time in between activities so you can recover to fully enjoy.Let me know if I can answer any other equations for you in the comments below.Winter travel guide to Alaska was originally published in Travel Wonders on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.

GCP Comics #8 Security with reverse proxyA reverse proxy stands in front of your data, services, or virtual machines, catching requests from anywhere in the world and carefully checking each one to see if it is allowed.In order to decide (yes or no) the proxy will look at who and what.Who are you (the individual making the request)? Do you have access permission (authorization)?What are you using to make the request? How healthy is your device right now? What location are you at? At what time are you making the request?This issue of GCP Comics presents an example of accessing some rather confidential data from an airplane, and uses that airplane as a metaphor to explain what the proxy is doing.Zero Trust with Reverse ProxyReverse proxies work as part of the load balancing step when requests are made to web apps or services, and they can be thought of as another element of the network infrastructure that helps route requests to the right place. If the request is invalid, either because it is from an unauthorized person or an unsafe device, then the proxy may deny the request.Why might the proxy say no to my request?I’m in Engineering, but I am trying to access Finance data.I’m not even a part of the company.My job changed, and I lost access.Looking at the device originating the request, the proxy could deny access due to:Device operating system out of dateMalware detectedDevice hasn’t checked in recentlyLocal software agents are not working properlyDisk encryption missingDevice doesn’t have screen lockResourcesFor more on proxies and Zero Trust, check out the following resources:Extending Zero Trust models to the webOverview of Identity-Aware ProxyHow to set up a proxy for on-premises appsWant more GCP Comics?

GCP Comics #7 Device securityIn a zero trust environment, every device has to earn trust in order to be granted access. When determining whether access should be granted, the security system relies on device metadata, such as what software is running or when the OS was last updated, and checks to see if the device meets that organization’s minimum bar for health.Think of it like your temperature: under 100 degrees and you are safe, but go over and you are now medically in fever territory, and you may not be allowed into certain venues.Zero Trust relies on WHO you are and WHAT you are using to determine accessIn this issue of GCP Comics we focus on devices, and how they play into a Zero Trust environment.Device data can take many forms, and can come from many sources. We recommend collecting multiple types of data from multiple systems and using it to make well-informed decisions on which devices get access to your important systems.What are some of those data types?Operating system version: to help you limit access for older, unsupported releasesPatch date: to find out if there are unpatched vulnerabilities presentLast check-in date: to understand how long this machine has been ‘offline’Binaries installed: to see if there’s any known malware or dangerous executablesExecutables run recently: to see if anything fishy is still runningDisk encryption: to see if the device complies with data protection policiesLocation data: to restrict access to some tools to only specific cities, states, or countriesUser(s) logged in recently: to see if other people might be sharing this deviceAnd where can you gather the data? There are many sources, including:DNS serversDHCP serversLocal agentsMobile device management solutionsOS-specific management toolsFor more on this topic, check out the following resources:OSQuery — Open source endpoint visibilityEndpoint Verification — Google Cloud inventory managementBeyondCorp: Building a Healthy FleetBeyondCorp: Design to Deployment at GoogleWant more GCP Comics?

How important are security key in zero trust?GCP Comics #6 Security keys in CybersecurityA security key is a physical device that works alongside your username and password to verify your identity to a site or app. They provide stronger login protection than an authenticator app or SMS codes, and the same device can be used for many services, so you don’t need to carry around a necklace of dongles and fobs.Security Keys provide the highest level of login assurance and phishing protection.In this issue of GCP Comics we are covering exactly that. Think of a Security Key as a way to protect yourself–and your company–from bad passwords and tricked users, as it stops fake sites from tricking people into logging in. Here you go!Security keys and zero trustA password alone turns out to be fairly minimal protection for an account, so we’ve seen many new options for 2-Step Verification (also called multi-factor authentication), a phrase meaning “more than just your username and password” to log in.Getting a code by SMS or voice call is a little better than just a password, but you can still be fooled into feeding that code to a fake site, giving up your account credentials to an attacker. Backup codes and authenticator apps fall prey to the same malicious strategies, where an attacker harvests your info and then uses it to perform their own multi-factor authentication, gaining access to your account.Only a security key can stop the cleverest of phishing attacks.Why a security key over other multi-factor methods?A key must be registered in advance to a specific account, an action you take once to enhance the level of security for your sign in.The security key and the website perform a cryptographic handshake, and if the site doesn’t validate the key’s identity, including matching a previously registered URL, the login is stopped.Using open standards (FIDO) the same security key can be used for multiple sites and devices. You only need to carry one around, and they can be used for both personal and work accounts and devices.The firmware of Google Titan Security Keys is engineered to verify integrity, preventing any tampering.They come in all kinds of shapes and sizes, so you can get USB-A, USB-C, or NFC to match the use case that fits you best!In our experience deploying security keys to replace older forms of 2-Step Verification, we’ve seen both faster logins and fewer support tickets raised.ResourcesTitan Security Keys2-Step Verification overviewAdvanced Protection ProgramWant more GCP Comics?

Data Science project for sustainable energyGoogle Cloud and Makani behind-the-scenes story to fight climate change.How do you approach the monumental challenge of innovating renewable energy?During a 13-year project that concluded in 2020, the Makani team took on this challenge using technology inspired by kite surfing. I was intrigued and wanted to learn more about the project and how Google Cloud played a part in the search for a new kind of wind powered energy.https://medium.com/media/f9cdd57d8af407dbe80a9bf997915c1a/hrefHow did the Makani’s wind energy kite actually work?Makani’s energy kite was an aerodynamic wing tethered to a ground station. To begin flight, the kite used rotors to hover vertically in the air. Once at full tether length, the kite transitioned into crosswind flight, flying in loops. As the kite flew, the rotors were spun by the wind, generating electricity that was sent down the tether to the grid. The kite’s path was managed by a flight computer, which guided the kite even in turbulent winds and safely returned it to the ground station.How was the Makani kite different from a traditional turbine?To understand how the Makani energy kite worked, it is helpful to look at how the mechanics of a traditional wind turbine translate into a crosswind kite. The blades on a wind turbine redirect wind and create one force that pushes on the tower and another that pushes the blades forward. The forward push of the blades turns a generator to make power. A crosswind kite is like freeing a blade from the tower. The freed blade (now acting as a wing), is able to grab more wind, therefore making more power than it could when stuck on the tower. The crosswind kite generates more power than a wind turbine for the same size wing, but with less materials.How wind energy kites workThe iterative processFor a project like this, flying a real kite is expensive. So, Makani’s team created software that would simulate the kite flying and all of its components. The simulations incorporated the physical laws that apply to a real kite. The team ran a bunch of simulations, analyzed the results, and then flew a real kite, gathering data from the test flight. They performed further analysis on that data and iterated the whole process again until they were satisfied with the results.Simulate → Analyze → Fly Real Kite → Analyze → RepeatRunning SimulationsThe simulation software created by Makani’s team could simulate the kite flying at different altitudes, and under a wide range of wind conditions. They generated hundreds of different configurations to simulate a flight and then fed these configurations into Compute Engine instances to run the kite simulations. These instances were created dynamically to run the simulations. The resulting log files and generated reports were saved in Google Cloud Storage. The Compute Engine instances then shut themselves down, saving costs.After the simulations were complete, the software engineers pulled the logs from Google Cloud Storage and analyzed them, looking for issues, red flags, or areas for potential improvement. Based on these findings they’d make modifications to the kite model and restart the entire process, repeating it until the team felt confident that the real kite wouldn’t crash under those simulated configurations.Testing the Real KiteOnce satisfied with the performance of the kite under simulation, the team would go to a testing site in Hawaii or Norway to fly an actual kite. As the kite flew, data was collected at the command center on ground. When the test flights were completed, the logs were sent to Google Cloud Storage for engineers to analyze. They repeated the same process — exploring the data, analyzing it, making modifications, and rerunning simulations to verify the changes would make the kite fly better (and not crash) before conducting another round of real-world tests.Analyzing DataAt times the engineers analyzed data manually, by downloading the log file to their computer, and loading it into MATLAB or running Python scripts to complete the analysis.But with a large scale project like this, manual analysis was simply too time consuming. The team needed well-defined, consistent, and automated analyses that could run over and over on all flight data. So, they built a data analytics front end on App Engine. Using this front end, an engineer submitted a request for all the logs in a particular time range for analysis. App Engine stored the request into Cloud SQL and sent it to the Pub/Sub messaging service. Jenkins master then pulled the analysis request and distributed the job to several Compute Engine worker instances. Each worker sent a request to Cloud Storage for the log files it needed, processed them, stored the analysis results in Cloud SQL, and published them to App Engine. Once there, the engineer could examine the results from anywhere!SummaryTo sum up, the Makani team ran a bunch of simulations, collected a ton of data, and learned from it. Then they flew a real kite, studied test flight data, and repeated the process for the next successful flight. Google Cloud played a critical role in this process by providing them a scalable infrastructure for simulations and data analytics, enabling them to stay focused on the real problem of harnessing wind energy.Though the Makani team’s journey has drawn to an end, they set up a portfolio of open source resources that you can explore!

Best cheatsheet to answer “What is Dataproc?”All you need to know about Google Cloud DataprocManaged Hadoop &amp; Spark #GCPSketchnoteIf you are using Hadoop ecosystem and want to make it easier to manage then Dataproc is the tool to checkout.Dataproc is a managed Spark and Hadoop service that lets you take advantage of open source data tools for batch processing, querying, streaming, and machine learning.Dataproc automation helps you create clusters quickly, manage them easily, and save money by turning clusters off when you don’t need them. With less time and money spent on administration, you can focus on what matters the most — your DATA!In this video I summarize the what Dataproc offers in 2 mins.https://medium.com/media/74402644f4a04cb0b5221108c4f39ea2/hrefErin and Sam are part of growing data science team using Apache Hadoop ecosystem and are dealing with operational inefficiencies! So, they are looking at Dataproc which installs a Hadoop cluster in 90 seconds, making it simple, fast and cost effective to gain insights as compared to a traditional cluster management activities. It supports:Open source tools — Hadoop, Spark ecosystemCustomizable virtual machines that scale up and down as neededOn demand ephemeral clusters to save costTightly integrates with other Google Cloud services.To move you Hadoop/Spark jobs, all you do is copy your data into Google Cloud Storage, update your file paths from HDFS to GS and you are are ready!Dataproc cheatsheet #GCPSketchnoteBrief explanation of how does Dataproc works:It disaggregates storage &amp; compute. Say an external application is sending logs that you want to analyze, you store them in a data source. From Cloud Storage(GCS) the data is used by Dataproc for processing which then stores it back into GCS, BigQuery or Bigtable. You could also use the data for Analysis in a notebook and send logs to Cloud Monitoring and Logging.Since storage is separate, for a long-lived cluster you could have one cluster per job but to save cost you could use ephemeral clusters that are grouped and selected by labels. And finally, you can also use the right amount of memory, CPU and Disk to fit the needs of your application.Next stepsIf you like this #GCPSketchnote then subscribe to my YouTube channel where I post a sketchnote on one topic every week!

What is Zero Trust Identity security?GCP Comics #5 Identity and Zero Trust ModelAutors: Priyanka Vergadia &amp; Max SalonstallGCP ComicsA zero trust network is one in which no person, device, or network enjoys inherent trust. All trust, which allows access to information, must be earned, and the first step of that is demonstrating valid identity. A system needs to know who you are, confidently, before it can determine what you should have access to. Add to that the understanding of what you can access — authorization — and you’ve got the core foundation of zero trust security.At Google we rely on a zero trust system known as BeyondCorp, to move beyond the idea of a privileged corporate network.In this issue of GCP Comics we discuss ways of acquiring trust, as our friend attempts to visit some distant relatives.Why set up a zero trust model?Here are a few compelling reasons for setting up a zero trust system:Preserve the productivity of your employees working from home, from the office, from a coffee shop, or from anywhere elseDeploy quickly, faster than a traditional VPN system, for rapid onboardingSpin up new device access quickly in case of unexpected latté-applied-to-laptop and similar incidentsGive each web application its own access control, for precise security and lower riskDecide access based on identity, device health, location, time of day, or other factorsGoogle zero trust tools can protect your workloads on any public cloud, or on-premises, so you don’t need to move your applications to improve their securityWhat are the benefits of zero trust?Lower frictionZero trust systems can be invisible to the employees at your company. They sign in, they use a strong second factor, and they are ready to go.PortabilityThe authentication and authorization aren’t tied to your location. Previous methods of access control relied on trusted networks, giving privileged access to anyone inside the established corporate network. With a zero trust model it’s easy to work from home and access all the same systems and tools.SafetySwitching to a zero trust system has helped Google, and many other enterprises, reduce their exposure and minimize security incidents, proactively stopping phishing-based attacks and lateral movement after a compromise.ResourcesBeyondCorp Remote Access, our enterprise grade security offering for protecting workloads on Google Cloud, other clouds, or on-premisesBeyondCorp at Google, our own zero trust implementationPublished research papers on how Google created, deployed, and evolved the BeyondCorp model.Identity-Aware Proxy, The Google Cloud protective layer used to create context-based access to apps, VMs, and services.Want more GCP Comics?

HOW IS DATA ENCRYPTED IN CLOUD?GCP Comics #4: Encryption to secure your data in cloudGCP ComicsEncryption is a process that takes plaintext as input, and transforms it into an output (ciphertext) that reveals little or no information about the plaintext. A public encryption algorithm is used, but execution depends on a key, which is kept secret. To decrypt the ciphertext back to its original form, the key needs to be used.When you use Google Cloud, the data is encrypted at rest and in transit to protect the data.Encryption at rest — used to protect data that is stored on a disk (including solid-state drives) or backup media.Encryption in transit — used to protect data that is traveling over the Internet, moving within Google’s infrastructureIn this issue of GCP Comics we are covering exactly that…Here you go!Encryption at rest in Google CloudGoogle uses several layers of encryption to protect customer data at rest. All customer content stored at rest is encrypted, without any action required from the customer, using one or more encryption mechanisms. All data stored in Google Cloud is encrypted at the storage level using AES256, with the exception of a small number of Persistent Disks created before 2015 that use AES128.Data for storage is split into chunks, and each chunk is encrypted with a unique data encryption key. These data encryption keys are stored with the data, encrypted with (“wrapped” by) key encryption keys that are exclusively stored and used inside Google’s central Key Management Service. Google’s Key Management Service is redundant and globally distributed.Google uses a common cryptographic library, Tink, which incorporates our FIPS 140–2 validated module, BoringCrypto, to implement encryption consistently across almost all Google Cloud products. Consistent use of a common library means that only a small team of cryptographers needs to implement and maintain this tightly controlled and reviewed code.Encryption in transit in Google CloudGoogle applies several security measures to help ensure the authenticity, integrity, and privacy of data in transit.Data is encrypted and authenticated in transit at one or more network layers when it moves outside physical boundaries not controlled by Google or on behalf of Google. Data in transit inside a physical boundary controlled by or on behalf of Google is generally authenticated but not necessarily encrypted.Depending on the connection that is being made, Google applies default protections to data in transit. For example, communications are secured between the user and the Google Front End (GFE) using TLS.Google Cloud customers with additional requirements for encryption of data over WAN can choose to implement further protections for data as it moves from a user to an application, or virtual machine to virtual machine. These protections include IPSec tunnels, Gmail S/MIME, managed SSL certificates, and Istio.Google works actively with the industry to help bring encryption in transit to everyone, everywhere and plans to remain the industry leader in encryption in transit.ResourcesTo learn more about security on Google Cloud, check out this link to the detailed security whitepaper.Encryption at rest in Google CloudEncryption in transit in Google CloudWant more GCP Comics?

What is Defense in depth?GCP Comics #3: Defense in DepthGCP ComicsSecurity is one of the great challenges of our time. Imagine being Google as part of serving and protecting eight apps with more than a billion users each. Google filters millions of spam messages a minute, spots thousands of suspicious web pages a day, and delivers almost unimaginable amounts of encrypted traffic, over what may be the world’s largest proprietary network. With Google Cloud, you get to use this sophisticated security in your businesses and apps.To help create a secure foundation, Google Cloud takes a defense in depth approach.In this issue of GCP Comics we are covering exactly that! We will go over defense in depth and learn how Google Cloud has built multiple layers of protection right into the infrastructure.Here you go! Read on and please share your thoughts in the comments below.How does Google Cloud’s multi-layer defense work?The hardware is Google controlled, built and hardened.Any application binary that runs on Google infrastructure is deployed securely.There is no assumption of any trust between services, and multiple mechanisms are used to establish and maintain trust — the infrastructure was designed to be multi-tenant from the beginning.All identities, users and services, are strongly authenticated.Data stored on Google’s infrastructure is automatically encrypted at rest and distributed for availability and reliability.Communications over the Internet to Google Cloud services are encrypted.The scale of the infrastructure allows to absorb many Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and there are multiple layers of protection that further reduce the risk of any DDoS impact.The operations teams detect threats and respond to incidents 24 x 7 x 365.Intrigued? Here is a whitepaper on the Google Infrastructure Design that goes into all of these areas in significant detail.How Google delivers Defense in Depth?BeyondCorp — Google’s Zero trust security model for your appsNow that you know how Google Cloud implements layered defense in depth for its infrastructure, let us throw some light on how to create the same zero trust model for your own apps on Google Cloud.For your applications on Google Cloud, you can apply BeyondCorp, which is Google’s implementation of the zero trust security model. The idea is that you shift access controls from the network perimeter to individual users and devices. BeyondCorp allows employees, contractors, and other users to work more securely from virtually any location without the need for a traditional VPN. This provides the access control that you need to protect the apps and the data within your environment.ConclusionDefense is depth is a concept to secure your data and apps. In this article we saw how Google protects its infrastructure using multiple layers of defense and by apply zero trust model at each layer. Additionally by applying BeyondCorp principles you can shift access control to the users instead of network perimeter and protect your apps &amp; data.ResourcesTo learn more about security on Google Cloud, check out this link to the detailed security whitepaper.Want more GCP Comics?
