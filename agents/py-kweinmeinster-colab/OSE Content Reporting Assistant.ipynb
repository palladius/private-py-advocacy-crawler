Register If you've joined a new team recently like I have, you've probably had a lot of questions. And answers to those questions may or may not be things you can find easily, and might rely heavily on the generosity, and spare time of your teammates. Let's say you're a DevRel engineer, working with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to build and run microservices. Despite how willing your teammates are to help you get started, wouldn't it be nice if there were a way to get questions about Google Cloud answered without bothering your coworkers? Well, fortunately for you, and those supportive hypothetical teammates, Duet AI is available to answer your questions as you start in a new job, and will still be there as you explore more advanced options. You can see all those details in this narrative tutorial , but let's walk through a quick example here. Getting to know you Suppose you have a service or app already running, and you'd like to get to know it a bit better. A bit more personal, if you will. Logging helps tremendously when you're exploring a new system. But finding the right options and flags to set can be a bit of a challenge. But you know what’s not a challenge? Asking Duet AI for the logs you need, with natural language. How can I write a Cloud Logging query to search for logs from Pods in a namespace called \"default\" in a GKE cluster named \"test\"? You should get a response something like the following, allowing for variation due to the built-in creativity of LLMs, of course. To write a Cloud Logging query to search for logs from Pods in a namespace called \"default\" in GKE cluster called \"test\", you can use the following query: [1] resource.type=\"k8s_container\" resource.labels.namespace_name=\"default\" resource.labels.cluster_name=\"test\" Generated code may be subject to license restrictions not shown here. Use code with care. Learn more This query will search for all logs from Pods in the \"default\" namespace in the \"test\" GKE cluster. You can also use the logName field to specify the type of logs you want to search for. For example, the following query will search for all stdout logs from Pods in the \"default\" namespace in the \"test\" GKE cluster: resource.type=\"k8s_container\" resource.labels.namespace_name=\"default\" resource.labels.cluster_name=\"test\" logName=\"projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/stdout\" Generated code may be subject to license restrictions not shown here. Use code with care. Learn more Where PROJECT_ID is the ID of your Google Cloud project. For more information on writing Cloud Logging queries, see the Cloud Logging documentation . Precisely my cup of tea And once you've run the command, you can click on \"Explain this query\" in each of the logs to get help understanding each of the log entries. If you're trying out the Vision Api, you might notice a log entry like the one below: There's a lot here, but what does it mean? The \"Explain this log entry\" button in the upper left hand corner will open discussion with Duet AI as shown below: You can then follow up from this request. Suppose you want to know more about how to adjust the batch size for Vision API. You could continue the discussion: You even have the ability to check the documentation if you want to know more by showing the related content: (This example comes from the Jump Start Solution Generative AI document summarization if you'd like to explore Gen AI more.) Learning about you every day Once you understand the current situation, you may be in a more informed position to decide to make changes, like creating a private build environment. Duet AI is there to help throughout your entire process: from describing the right tools, to telling you how to use them effectively, answering questions as you go. For even more on how this all works, and how you can get started, check out the narrative tutorial . So take a look, and impress those hypothetical teammates with how quickly you’re able to contribute to your new team.

Register Introduction As you orchestrate more services with Workflows , the workflow gets more complicated with more steps, jumps, iterations, parallel branches. When the workflow execution inevitably fails at some point, you need to debug and figure out which step failed and why. So far, you only had an execution summary with inputs/outputs and logs to rely on in your execution debugging. While this was good enough for basic workflows, it didn't provide step level debugging information. The newly released execution steps history solves this problem. You can now view step level debugging information for each execution from the Google Cloud console or the REST API. This is especially useful for complicated workflows with lots of steps and parallel branches. In this blog we will take a closer look at a concrete example of Workflows execution steps history. Running BigQuery jobs in parallel In an earlier blog post, Introducing Parallel Steps for Workflows , and its associated tutorial , we showed a workflow ( workflow-parallel.yaml ) that queries 5 BigQuery tables using parallel branches of Workflows to speed up processing. The workflow outline is as follows: Loading... init\n",
            "runQueries\n",
            "runQueries.1\n",
            "logTable.1 \n",
            "runQuery.1\n",
            "returnResult.1\n",
            "\t…\n",
            "runQueries.5\n",
            "logTable.5 \n",
            "runQuery.5\n",
            "returnResult.5\n",
            "returnResults runQueries step is a combination of 5 parallel branches where each table query happens in parallel. Debugging with the execution steps history Let’s assume you made a mistake with the name of one of the tables and you point to a non-existing table. Can the new execution steps history help us to debug that mistake? Loading... - init:\n",
            "        assign:\n",
            "            - results : {}\n",
            "            - tables:\n",
            "                - 201201h\n",
            "                - 201202h\n",
            "                - NonExistingTable\n",
            "                - 201204h\n",
            "                - 201205h First, as the execution is running, you’ll realize a new steps tab under execution details in Google Cloud console: Under the steps tab, you start seeing some steps succeeded, running, and failed: This is already very useful in visualizing and understanding what happens under the hood! Once the execution is finished, you will see that the top level runQueries step failed. You can filter to see its children steps: You see that one of the iterations (i.e. tables) of runQueries failed: Further filtering on runQueries.3 step, you realize that runQuery.3 failed: Finally, further zooming into runQuery.3 reveals that the step received HTTP status 404 which hints that the table in question might not exist: At this point, you can look into logs and get to the exact reason for HTTP 404, the non-existing table. We went from a failed execution to the exact failed step in a parallel branch and the actual HTTP 404 error pretty quickly! Summary The new execution steps history makes it easier to understand what happens under the hood with an execution. While most developers will use the Google Cloud console to view the steps history, you can access the same information from the REST API as well. We will keep improving the developer experience with 2 more features scheduled for Workflows execution. You will be able to see progress for loops, parallel branches, retries and also see a detailed view of inputs/outputs and user variables. Stay tuned! Next Steps To learn more, check out the view history of execution steps documentation and the visualize and Inspect Workflows Executions blog post from Guillaume Laforge. You can also utilize the official Workflows samples and experiment with how the execution steps history helps.

            "URL: https://glaforge.dev/posts/2024/01/16/java-functional-builder-approach/\n",
            "Contents: Functional builder approach in Java ❯ Guillaume Laforge BLOG TALKS ABOUT Functional builder approach in Java 📅 January 16, 2024 — by Guillaume Laforge java golang design-pattern In Java, builders are a pretty classical pattern for creating complex objects with lots of attributes.\n",
            "A nice aspect of builders is that they help reduce the number of constructors you need to create,\n",
            "in particular when not all attributes are required to be set (or if they have default values). However, I’ve always found builders a bit verbose with their newBuilder() / build() method combos,\n",
            "especially when you work with deeply nested object graphs, leading to lines of code of builders of builders of… As I was chatting about those builders with my colleague Valentin ,\n",
            "who is a Go developer, he told me about Golang’s functional builder approach.\n",
            "It’s not a very common implementation practice for Java builders, but it’s worth revisiting! First, the classical builder Let’s start with an example.\n",
            "We want to create a builder for a class with a few attributes.\n",
            "Not all attributes are mandatory, some may have some default values,\n",
            "and we don’t want to create as many constructors as possible combinations of attributes. Let me introduce you to my SomeModel class: public class SomeModel { private String modelName ; private Float temperature = 0.3f ; private Integer maxOutputTokens = 100 ; // ... possibly many other attribtues private SomeModel ( String modelName , Float temperature , Integer maxOutputTokens ) { this . modelName = modelName ; this . temperature = temperature ; this . maxOutputTokens = maxOutputTokens ; } } Creating tons of constructors for the various model configurations can be painful.\n",
            "Furthermore, some attributes can have the same type, so from a user perspective, it’s hard to know which value corresponds to which parameter type.\n",
            "So creating a builder can reduce that toil. We could write a static builder class inside SomeModel along the lines of: public class SomeModelBuilder { private String modelName ; private Float temperature = 0.3f ; private Integer maxOutputTokens = 100 ; public SomeModelBuilder modelName ( String modelName ) { this . modelName = modelName ; return this ; } public SomeModelBuilder temperature ( Float temperature ) { this . temperature = temperature ; return this ; } public SomeModelBuilder maxOutputTokens ( Integer maxOutputTokens ) { this . maxOutputTokens = maxOutputTokens ; return this ; } public SomeModel build () { return new SomeModel ( modelName , temperature , maxOutputTokens ); } } Inside SomeModel you would add a method to instantiate a builder: public static SomeModelBuilder newBuilder () { return new SomeModelBuilder (); } Then, the user would create a model instance with the builder as follows: var model = SomeModel . newBuilder () . modelName ( \"gemini\" ) . temperature ( 0.2f ) . maxOutputToken ( 300 ) . build (); Not too bad.\n",
            "The are some variations to this approach, like passing the builder in the class’ constructor,\n",
            "using setter methods that return this , using or not using final fields, etc.\n",
            "But they are mostly stylistic variations. However, I was wondering about this idea of a functional builder… Existing functional approaches in Java I haven’t found much litterature on this theme.\n",
            "There are 2 blog posts\n",
            "( here and there )\n",
            "that suggest an approach with lambda expressions and Consumer s,\n",
            "but I find it even more unconventional than the approach I’m going to describe further in this article: SomeModel model = new SomeModelBuilder () . with ( $ -> { $ . modelName = \"Gemini\" ; $ . temperature = 0.4f ; }) . with ( $ -> $ . maxOutputTokens = 100 ); You can pass one or more lambdas in chained calls.\n",
            "It’s the end-user who controls how the model is built, not the implementor, so I feel it’s less safe.\n",
            "The use of the $ sign is a bit of a syntactical hack to avoid repeating the name of the variable corresponding to the model.\n",
            "Finally, there’s still a builder class after all, and maybe we can find a way to get rid of it. Let’s see what Go has to offer instead, and if we can get some inspiration from it! The Go approach My colleague Valentin pointed me at Dave Cheney’s article on Go’s functional option pattern.\n",
            "There’s also a video available. The idea is that the class’ constructor takes function options as a vararg paramter,\n",
            "that are able to modify the instance that’s being built. Let’s illustrate this with the following snippet. We create a struct that represents our model object like in our Java example: package main import \"fmt\" type SomeModel struct { modelName string temperature float32 maxOutputTokens int } We define a method to construct our model, which takes a vararg of options: func NewModel (options ... func ( * SomeModel)) ( * SomeModel) { m := SomeModel{ \"\" , 0.3 , 100 } for _, option := range options { option ( & m) } return & m } Those options are actually functions that take a model object as parameter. Now we can create utility methods that create such option functions,\n",
            "and we pass the value for each field of the struct via the method parameter.\n",
            "So we have a method for each structure field: model name, temperature and max output tokens: func modelName (name string ) func ( * SomeModel) { return func (m * SomeModel) { m.modelName = name } } func temperature (temp float32 ) func ( * SomeModel) { return func (m * SomeModel) { m.temperature = temp } } func maxOutputTokens (max int ) func ( * SomeModel) { return func (m * SomeModel) { m.maxOutputTokens = max } } Next we can create the model in the following way, by calling the utility methods that return functions\n",
            "that are able to modify the struct . func main () { m := NewModel ( modelName ( \"gemini\" ), temperature ( 0.5 ), maxOutputTokens ( 100 )) fmt. Println (m) } Notice there’s not even a NewBuilder() or Build() method! Let’s implement our functional builder in Java! We can follow the same approach in Java.\n",
            "Instead of Go functions, we’ll use Java’s lambdas.\n",
            "Our lambdas will be converted into Consumer s of SomeModel . So let’s recreate our SomeModel class, with the same fields as before.\n",
            "This time, however, the constructor won’t be private , and it’ll take a list of options\n",
            "(lambda expressions that consume instances of SomeModel ).\n",
            "We’ll iterate over all of them to execute them: import java.util.function.Consumer ; public class SomeModel { private String modelName ; private Float temperature = 0.3f ; private Integer maxOutputTokens = 100 ; public SomeModel ( ModelOption ... options ) { for ( Option option : options ) { option . accept ( this ); } } Update #1: A neat suggestion by Eric Deandrea on Twitter to use streams to filter the null options,\n",
            "as I was not checking them with an extra if before calling accept() on the option: Optional . ofNullable ( options ) . map ( Stream :: of ) . orElseGet ( Stream :: empty ) . forEach ( option -> option . accept ( this )) And what is this ModelOption class? This is just a synonym for a Consumer<SomeModel> (so not strictly needed, but can help with readability).\n",
            "It’s a nested interface: public interface ModelOption extends Consumer < SomeModel > {} Next, we create similar utility methods that will update the model instance: public static ModelOption modelName ( String modelName ) { return model -> model . modelName = modelName ; } public static ModelOption temperature ( Float temperature ) { return model -> model . temperature = temperature ; } public static ModelOption maxOutputTokens ( Integer maxOutputTokens ) { return model -> model . maxOutputTokens = maxOutputTokens ; } } Now, if we want to create a model, we’ll be able to call the constructor as follows: import fn.builder.SomeModel ; import static fn.builder.SomeModel.* ; //... SomeModel model = new SomeModel ( modelName ( \"gemini\" ), temperature ( 0.5f ), maxOutputTokens ( 100 ) ); Don’t forget to use a static import to keep the syntax short. Discussion A few advantages I see with this approach: I like the fact we’re using a constructor to construct our model instances! And the constructor is super simple and short! It also means that the constructor won’t change when there’s going to be a new parameter to handle (better backward compatibility).\n",
            "On the other hand, with a traditional builder, the constructor could also take the builder itself as sole parameter. I’m also happy that I got rid of the verbose newBuilder() / build() combo.\n",
            "It feels like we don’t really have a builder at play here. At first, I was wondering if I was opening the Pandora box, as I feared developers could provide their own lambda\n",
            "and potentially wreck havoc in my instance construction, but because of visibility rules,\n",
            "only my methods can modify the internals of the model class Although we’re using a constructor, the fact of passing those method calls as parameters, it feels a bit like having named arguments like in languages like Python or Groovy (which can also create builders for you via AST transformations).\n",
            "It also looks more like the classical builder too, which has that readability aspect. I can pass the arguments in whichever order I want. I can put validation rules both in each mutator method and in the constructor after all mutators have been called. Potential tweaks: I used non-final fields, because I wanted to be able to define my default values for some fields at definition time\n",
            "rather than in the constructor, but we could certainly tweak this implementation a bit if needed.\n",
            "And anyway, only my mutator methods can alter those fields, so I guess it’s fine. I was curious if I could use Java enum s for storing only my allowed mutators,\n",
            "but I haven’t found an effective and concise way of implementing this.\n",
            "Java enum s don’t work like Rust’s, but there’s an interesting article about this here on how to implement sum types. I wondered also about a mix of sealed interface s and maybe record s, but similarly to enum s,\n",
            "I couldn’t find a nice and short syntax that I was happy with. In the cons: It’s a bit unconventional, as I haven’t seen this approach implemented in the wild.\n",
            "So maybe the approach suffers in terms of readability. The other concerns I have is with discoverability.\n",
            "When auto-completing code, an IDE like IntelliJ is smart enough to suggest the mutators methods can be used inside the constructor.\n",
            "But it’s not that clear that such mutator methods exist.\n",
            "It’s going to be important to document the constructor to say that those mutators exist. Feedback I’d be curious to hear your thoughts on this.\n",

            "and that is often a URL-friendly variation of the title of the article . Interestingly, one of the most popular posts on my blog is an almost 20 year old article that explains\n",
            "how to remove accents from a string .\n",
            "And indeed, in slugs you would like to remove accents, among other things. So what problem are we trying to solve today?\n",
            "Let’s say you have an article whose title is “L’été, où est tu ?” (which translates to: “Summer, where have you been?” \").\n",
            "You want your blog to have a friendly URL that looks like the title,\n",
            "but without the punctuation, or the accents (also called diacritical marks),\n",
            "and you also want to replace spaces with hyphens.\n",
            "The final URL should then be https://myblog.com/l-ete-ou-est-tu . A naive approach would be to try to replace all the letters with diacritical marks with their non marked equivalents.\n",
            "So don’t try to replace “é” with “e”, etc. You’ll likely miss some letters in some languages.\n",
            "A better approach is to take advantage of Unicode normalization . If you are interested, you can learn more about unicode normalization on the Unicode.org website.\n",
            "But in a nutshell, some letters, like accented letters, are a combination of a base letter, and a diacritical mark. Let’s have a look at this image from the link above: The uppercase angström letter is comprised of\n",
            "the A uppercase letter , and the ring above diacritical mark.\n",
            "The composed letter has a unicode value of U+212B but can be decomposed\n",
            "into U+0041 (uppercase A) and U+30A (ring above) . I’ll spare you from the details of the various normalization forms.\n",
            "But Java allows you to work with the normalized forms of letters thanks to the java.text.Normalizer class.\n",
            "We’ll also take advantage of Java’s regex Pattern class to identify particular classes of characters. Be sure to check the Javadocs of the Normalizer and Pattern classes: Normalizer Pattern The former explains how to do string normalization, and the latter will give you the list of available character classes. Let’s have a look at the following Java snippet: import java.text.Normalizer ; String title = \"L'été, où es tu ?\" Normalizer . normalize ( title , Normalizer . Form . NFD ) . toLowerCase () // \"l'été, où es tu ?\" . replaceAll ( \"\\\\p{IsM}+\" , \"\" ) // \"l'ete, ou es tu ?\" . replaceAll ( \"\\\\p{IsP}+\" , \" \" ) // \"l ete  ou es tu  \" . trim () // \"l ete  ou es tu\" . replaceAll ( \"\\\\s+\" , \"-\" ) // \"l-ete-ou-es-tu\" My approach is usually the following: First, I normalize the text into the NFD form (canonical decomposition) , so base characters and diacritical marks are now separated, Then, I’m replacing all the uppercase letters with lowercase ones, Next, we use the IsM property which selects the the diacritical marks, and we remove them Simiarly, we look at the characters which are punctuation, with the IsP binary property, and replace them with spaces I usually trim the string at that point, as I don’t want to have spaces at the beginning or end of the strings (when a punctuation mark is replace with a space in the previous step) Eventually, all the space characters are replaced with hyphens. Slugify Recently, I came across a Java library that takes care of creating slugs: Slugify ! With Slugify, you can do a similar transformation as mine, with the following code: import com.github.slugify.Slugify ; Slugify slugify = Slugify . builder (). build (); slugify . slugify ( \"L'été, où es tu ?\" ) // \"lete-ou-es-tu\" A small difference here is that the quote is removed, which leads to having the string lete instead of l-ete .\n",
            "I find that a bit less readable at a glance, but Slugify has various knobs you can tweak to customize its output. There’s one particular thing I like about this library, it’s its use of the ICU4J library, which supports transliteration ( ICU is a well known set of libraries for full unicode and globalization support.) The problem with our examples above is that they work well for language with latin-like alphabets.\n",
            "But my examples keep characters like ideograms intact, and Slugify removes them by default.\n",
            "If you want to have URLs that stay within the ASCII realm,\n",
            "you can use transliteration ,\n",
            "which can map text in one language into readable latin-like text that sounds like the original text. So if I wanted to transliterate my string into ascii-friendly text, I could use Slugify’s integration of ICU: import com.github.slugify.Slugify ; Slugify slugify = Slugify . builder () . transliterator ( true ) // use transliteration . locale ( Locale . ENGLISH ) . build () slugify . slugify ( \"夏よ、どこにいるの？\" ) // \"xiayo-dokoniiruno\" ← PREVIOUS Gemini Function Calling NEXT → Functional builder approach in Java LATEST POSTS Visualize PaLM-based LLM tokens Image generation with Imagen and LangChain4j Serving static assets with Micronaut Light Mode Bookmarlet Functional builder approach in Java LATEST TALKS Generative AI in practice: Concrete LLM use cases in Java, with the PaLM API From Bird to Elephant: Starting a New Journey on Mastodon Google Cloud Workflows API automation, patterns, and best practices Choreography vs orchestration in microservices and best practices Reuse old smartphones to monitor 3D prints with WebRTC WebSockets and serverless © 2024 Guillaume Laforge\n",

Happy new years and welcome to the Kubernetes Podcast from Google. I'm your host, Abdel Sghiouar. KASLIN FIELDS: And I'm Kaslin Fields. [UPBEAT MUSIC] ABDEL SGHIOUAR: This week, we speak to Johnny Horvi and Frode Sundby from NAV, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration. We talked about NAIS, a Kubernetes platform that allows developers to focus on building apps without worrying about the underlying complexity of Kubernetes. KASLIN FIELDS: But first, let's get to the news. [MUSIC PLAYING] Since the release of Kubernetes 1.29, the community has been busy publishing detailed writings on the features in this version, starting from the out-of-tree cloud integration removal to contextual logging and more. You'll find the list of these articles in the show notes, if you want a deep-dive into what's new in 1.29. Also, don't forget to check out our interview with the release lead. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Cisco acquired Isovalent for an undisclosed amount. The network giant merging with the cloud-native firm known for its leadership position on eBPF and Cilium aims to strengthen Cisco's position in the cloud space. KASLIN FIELDS: In Cilium news, the community released their annual report. This is a significant one for the project, as Cilium reached graduated status in 2023. The report highlights the growth of the project, both in contributions and adoption. The link is in the show notes. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: KubeCon and CloudNativeCon Europe in Paris will bring the first ever CNCF hackathon in collaboration with the United Nations Office of Information and Communications Technology. The hackathon will focus on advancing the delivery of the UN Sustainable Development goals. The in-person hackathon will run alongside KubeCon Paris from March 19 to 21, 2024. The winners will be announced during the keynote on Friday, March 22. KASLIN FIELDS: OpenFeature is now a CNCF incubating project. OpenFeature is an open specification that offers a vendor-agnostic API for feature-flagging and is compatible with various feature flag management tools. Feature flags are a software engineering way to enable, disable, or alter the behavior of certain features without modifying the source code of the application. And that's the news. [MUSIC PLAYING] ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Well, hello, everyone, and welcome to a new episode of the Kubernetes Podcast. I'm your host, Abdel. Today, I'm talking to Johnny and Frode. Johnny and Frode are developers at NAV's platform team. We are here today to talk about NAIS, spelled N-A-I-S, but pronounced \"nice,\" like nice things, a Kubernetes-based team-centric platform aiming at providing the tools needed to deploy and operate apps easily. In other terms, the framework is a non-pretentious platform engineering tool. Welcome to the show, Johnny and Frode. FRODE SUNDBY: Why, thank you. JOHNNY HORVI: Thank you very much. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: So we're going to talk extensively about NAIS and NAV, but let's just start with a very high-level introduction. Who are you? And what do you do at NAV? Maybe we can start with Frode. FRODE SUNDBY: I'm now a developer working at the platform team. I've been in NAV for, I think it's 12 years now. And for the duration of my time in NAV, I've been working on making it easier for developers to get applications out to production, ranging back to the days when we built a platform for JBoss and WebSphere applications to now containers and Kubernetes. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Cool. What about you, Johnny? Can you introduce yourself? JOHNNY HORVI: Sure. I'm Johnny. I have worked in NAV basically since 2009, started off as a consultant in 2016. I joined NAV as an internal employee. And all along, I've been working with providing infrastructure functionality and starting off with basic configuration management and deployment mechanism automating this and moving on to more infrastructure. And then in 2017, we started building NAIS. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Speaking of NAIS, let's just get going. We'll talk about NAV later. But can one of you tell us a little bit, what is NAIS? What's the history of this platform? FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah, as I mentioned in my introduction, we had some deployment tools and some ways of making applications go to production for developers in NAV. We've been having that for a long time. As Johnny said, he started working on this thing back in 2009 or something, so it wasn't a complete foreign concept to NAV even going back a long time. But then in 2016, I think it was, Johnny and I attended a course with Kelsey Hightower, where he showed us the magic of Kubernetes. And, yeah, we were quite blown away. And so, oh, here's something we could make use of. This is a lot more efficient than automating JBosses. Let's try it. JOHNNY HORVI: So we've been looking at containers and Docker for a while. And at this time, it wasn't that clear that Kubernetes was the absolute best choice for everyone because you had Mesos and you had other alternatives. But after this workshop with Kelsey, we figured it was time to go. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: So you had a workshop with Kelsey and then you decided, OK, Kubernetes is the way to go. Did you started building NAIS from day one, or was it more like, oh, let's just start using Kubernetes and figure out if it works for us and then eventually down the line figuring out we need a better tool? What was the story there? JOHNNY HORVI: Initially, when we started building this new platform, NAV was going through a large change in its organization as well. We were going from a kind of traditional IT where developers were simply developing applications and delivering software packages to the organization, and NAV had been doing this for a long time. And then it became obvious, even to the Norwegian government, that NAV wasn't able to actually deliver functioning services and software even though it had a very large budget. So in around 2015, '16, the entire management was switched out and NAV started focusing more on building autonomous teams, allowing them to take full ownership of their applications for the entirety of the life cycle of the application. This was the point where I joined NAV as well. And we figured we had to build a platform supporting this new way of working, basically, allowing the teams to be able to see and understand what's going on with their applications. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Nice. And that's actually why in the introduction I said it's a non-pretentious platform engineering team because I feel like this whole space of platform engineering and people talking about it, they're all more or less trying to solve the same problem. It's just that sometimes the focus is too much on the actual tooling rather than the concepts of like-- or rather than the focus is mostly, let's try to make developer's life easier, right? So speaking about that, can one of you give me like a quick introduction of what is NAIS? We know what it's trying to solve, making developer's life easier, but what is the platform itself? FRODE SUNDBY: Technically, it is pretty simple. It's just Kubernetes. And we've built some abstractions on top of Kubernetes, making Kubernetes more accessible. Like, if a developer or an application needs X amount of runtime, they need an ingress, they need a database, they can just express this in a one-application manifest and then deploy mechanisms, and we will make sure that all the Kubernetes resources are available and they are functioning together. In a nutshell, it's just making Kubernetes and the runtime environment around the application easier, that's what it is. JOHNNY HORVI: And just for me, for higher abstraction, the problem that we're trying to solve is to allow our developers to primarily focus on solving business problems. And today, a developer kind of have to care about a lot of things if they are to actually develop and run their application. And this ranges from, like I mentioned, from runtime environment to, how do I secure my application, how do I provision databases, messaging queues, observability tools, so they know what's going on. And what NAIS is is trying to take all these different aspects and package them into products, deliver this to the application teams so they can choose the things that make sense for them. FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah, building blocks, sort of. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, that's actually interesting because I think a lot of times when people talk about abstraction layers on top of Kubernetes because, I mean, let's face it, Kubernetes isn't the most developer-friendly tool out there. But when people talk about abstraction layer on top of Kubernetes, they mostly focus on the runtime part, which is what Frode described, so the, my application, my ingress, my secrets, my volumes, and all that stuff. But NAIS does more than just that. Like, you can provision dependencies if you want to call them this way, like databases and other stuff that an app might need. FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Then, the next question, maybe if somebody listens to us and they don't really understand even what Kubernetes is, assuming everybody does because it's the whole point of the podcast, but let's take a step back. Can you help us understand it in the context of existing, maybe, third-party or open-source tools? What is the closest thing you can compare NAIS to? FRODE SUNDBY: I think we're not entirely there yet, but more in the realm of fly.io or Heroku, where you can just point to your code and say, please run this for us, and then the platform will give you all the tooling and all the insight you need as well. JOHNNY HORVI: After running this platform now since 2017, what we see is-- or the pattern and the use cases that we see is that you've covered a lot of ground if you're able to provide a solid runtime environment and good solutions around logging, and you have a SQL database and a messaging service and maybe a bucket, then you are pretty far along. It's bread and butter, basically. FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah, that is actually quite interesting because we've started, we thought that, OK, hey, hello, guys, let's open up this platform. Here's Google Cloud for you. You got your own project. You can do whatever you want. It's yours. You've got a namespace, it's yours. You can do whatever you want. All the resources are available to you. And what do we get? We get pods, databases, and buckets. That's all people are interested in and actually just their application, making it work, and the fancy things. We'll dabble with it, but not too much. We thought we would get so much innovation, but it's just bread and butter, as Johnny said. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: It's actually interesting. I've done some consulting in part of my career, and it's interesting to always think that people have unique requirements, but then it's like 99% of the use cases are pretty much the same. I need to run some code and write to a database and maybe store some files somewhere, right? FRODE SUNDBY: (AMUSED) Yes. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: That's interesting. So no spanner, nothing too fancy. No Vertex AI, nothing too fancy. FRODE SUNDBY: Some teams have dabbled with it, but it's not a big thing going around here. And I think that perhaps is showcasing the point of the platform is that the application portfolio in our organization, it is pretty standard. They just need the basic things. And if we make a platform that makes the standard stuff, the bread and butter, make that easy, that means the teams that own the applications, they want to run on our platform because we provide exactly what they need and we don't try to do everything else at the same time. So the things that we build, it is sort of like a golden path for the application team saying, OK, we provide a database. We haven't given them too many options. It's a managed Postgres, that's what you get. You're allowed to do, use whatever other database technology you want. You can set it up yourself and manage it, but we've built Postgres, and pretty much all the teams use it. And even though we're not saying, use Postgres, because that is what we have decided, people use it because it's easy. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: I see. JOHNNY HORVI: I think what we've discovered is that a lot of, or most of the developers, as long as they're able to just run their application and get this basic functionality and it just works for them, they really don't care. They don't care about Kubernetes. They don't care about the infrastructure parts. They might have some knobs and buttons that they want to tweak, but in general, it's pretty low interest. And this was kind of interesting because starting out, we thought that because we were probably biased ourselves, because we are interested in these things, they must be too. And we're kind of exposed to those developers that are super interested in these things and they are very active. But I think that the large majority of the developers don't really care as long as this works and that they are provided with sufficiently insight into what their application is doing, how it's behaving, how the thing that they are creating is affecting the world. So we don't create a magic layer that fixes everything for them but we try to kind of remove some of the complexities and make it easier for them to understand what's going on without being super experts in every single aspect. FRODE SUNDBY: Well, that is a good point because we've been running Kubernetes since-- oh, we've been dabbling with it since 2016. And we know our services and deployments and secrets and everything. But still, we use our own tools because it's just so much easier to just write an application spec than to remember and to fill in all the different YAML files. It's just easier. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah. JOHNNY HORVI: So the application spec is the abstraction that we've created on top of all that is needed to kind of stitch together a functioning deployment workload in NAIS. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Can you walk me through the life of a developer on the platform? So I'm a new developer, I have an app. I built my app. I probably have a container, or maybe I don't. And I want to have a running application with an URL, a database, login, monitoring, whatever the platform offers. What would be that golden path? FRODE SUNDBY: Well, starting in NAV, our smallest interaction with the platform is from a team. So you are probably a member of an existing team or you are starting. So let's say you are starting in a brand new team. You would go to our console and say, I'm starting in team X. You go in, you plot it in, say, this is my new team, and you hook off all the things that your team needs. You need a Google project. You want a deployment key. You want a GitHub repository and all the bells and whistles that your team needs. And you say, who are the members of my team? And then the console will set up all the things in the ecosystem around, like the things that you want, and you can start writing your code. You write your \"hello, world\" application, you push it to your repository, and you use the deployment action to say, we want to deploy this application to this cluster using the key for my team. And your workflow will then build your code, test it, and deploy it to the cluster of your desire. And it's up to the teams then to build their workflows in a way which they are comfortable with, like deploy it first to the test production, run all your tests in the environment, then deploy to the production environment, for example. And the way that you describe what your application needs, as Johnny said, in an application manifest, which is just the Kubernetes' custom resource definition where they say, \"this is the ingress I want. This is how many pods I want, minimum, maximum. This is the amount of CPU memory I want. I would like a database and a bucket, please.\" And then once deployed to the cluster, our operator will take over and create all the required resources in the cluster in their namespace. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: OK. Yeah, so basically, you describe intent in the form of a YAML file, and then an operator plus a bunch of CRDs will generate the low-level Rho Kubernetes objects for you. FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: And then you can define-- I guess, you could call them dependencies. Do you consider, for example, login and monitoring as an optional or is it like they're out-of-the-box, available for people? JOHNNY HORVI: We use Prometheus for monitoring. So in your application manifest, you simply specify which endpoint that you expose your metrics on, and the platform will automatically scrape this endpoint and put it into Prometheus. And then we have a Grafana instance where this is hooked up as a data source, and it's available there. And there we have some standard dashboards, and you're able to make your own. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Cool. JOHNNY HORVI: And same with logging, basically. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: OK, so it's basically available out-of-the-box. And then you can optionally choose, I want a database, I want to expose via an ingress on a specific domain, those are like extra features, I guess, right? FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah. So you can start in your application manifest just saying, this is the image that I've built and pushed to the central repository, and that's it. That's pretty much all you need to tell us. This is my team, this is my image, run it, please. And then everything else is sane defaults or optional add-ons. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: I see. Cool. And then talking about this, like, is the platform itself composable? Can people just swap out certain components for things they want or, from experience, as you said earlier, did you realize people don't really care too much? JOHNNY HORVI: The way it's set up is that we don't have a lot of different options within each aspect. You can't select from three different login tools. So we provide a standard option that we feel covers most of the use cases. But since you have access to your own namespace, you have full access, basically. So you can create the kinds of resources that you want if you have other requirements that go outside of what's offered through the platform, so that's entirely possible. But like I mentioned earlier, it's very rare that this actually happens. And after having run the platform now for several years, we have covered at least a lot of the use cases, and most of the functionality is there. But it's still an option to set up things yourself. FRODE SUNDBY: If we see that there are a lot of teams who are spending a lot of time figuring out how to do a specific thing and they are all trying to do the same thing and solve the same problem, then it's when we as a platform team come into the picture and say, OK, we've got X amount of teams trying to solve Redis, for example. That is when we will add an operator and expand the application manifest to say, OK, you can now, say, have a Redis and build the tools for them to have that out of the box as well. So when it makes sense for us to build it as a central or a platform feature, that is when we will do it. If it is just one or two teams, we're not building platform functionality for a small amount of special use cases. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: I see. Cool. I like this, how the conversation started off. Over time, you realize most people just want standard things, like bread and butter. So people don't really care too much about, \"I just want to write code, solve my problem and just move on with my day,\" right? FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: So I want to switch gears a little bit because we started talking about NAV, NAV, NAV. What is NAV? Can you explain to the audience what does your organization do? FRODE SUNDBY: [LAUGHS] Yeah, that makes sense to actually clarify. NAV is the Norwegian Welfare Administration, I think would be the English term for it. JOHNNY HORVI: Labour and Welfare Administration. FRODE SUNDBY: Labour and Welfare, yeah. So for anyone outside of Scandinavia, I think the concept is perhaps a little bit foreign. But we've got one central government agency which is responsible for every service that the government hands out to the public from their born, where you get birth money and you get [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]-- I don't quite know what that would be in English, but where you get a monthly salary from the government for having a baby in practice. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Like a parental allowance, essentially, or a parental pay. JOHNNY HORVI: Yeah. FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah. JOHNNY HORVI: Sickness benefits, pension and retirement benefits, helping people back to work if you're unemployed, and unemployment benefits. FRODE SUNDBY: All the way to the pension when you are retired. All the pensions in Norway are paid out by NAV as well. So a third of the national budget in Norway is funneled through NAV going out, again, into paying back to the public. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: I think that this is pretty unique to Norway. I think most other countries, they pretty much don't have anything like this, like public pension or like parental allowance or parental money, or it's handled typically by different institutions. But Norway is a relatively small country, so having one entity doing this makes, I guess, a lot of sense, right? JOHNNY HORVI: As we can view, NAV is kind of the-- trying to oil the Norwegian machinery and support Norwegian citizens throughout life in their different phases. It's like copilot but for life. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Nice. FRODE SUNDBY: [LAUGHS] ABDEL SGHIOUAR: I like that comparison. So I was telling you earlier when we were preparing for this that I have been-- in 2019, I attended the meetup in Oslo where there was public institutions like NAV and institutions similar to NAV, like the Tax Agency, et cetera, together in the same room, presenting what they have been doing in the last few months, what they have learned, what pain points are they facing. And all of them are using different cloud platforms, and they seem to be very independent from each other. But it sounded like a forum for sharing knowledge and experience. And what was unique about it is that everybody who was present in the room was a public institution. I think there was also-- police were there. I don't remember who were the other ones. But is this a common thing across those public institutions in Norway? Is it, like, cultural? What's the story there? FRODE SUNDBY: It is a common thing now. It was unheard of in 2016 when we started with it. I think it was NAV and Tax administration who started this public forum. And it makes sense because all of the public agencies, they are trying to solve pretty much the same problem. And we have the same challenges. And we most often find the similar solutions to the same problems. So it makes sense that we should talk together and share the knowledge that we've learnt because we are paid by the same government. And it's the same government who is spending money in 40 different public agencies solving the same problem. So it's up to us to make it easier, save money, help each other. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Nice. JOHNNY HORVI: I would say that it's quite a lot of different solutions that springs out of this. What we see is that, like you said, we are solving basically the same problem, but we come to different conclusions. And it's very nice to see what other people are doing and what kind of directions they are moving their platforms, and so it's very helpful. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Is open-sourcing tools like NAIS, for example, also coming across other agencies, or you are like the only one who have a similar thing? JOHNNY HORVI: I think some of the other agencies have things that they open source. NAIS is basically just a collection of a lot of different functionality packaged as maybe a Kubernetes operator or some internal APIs and so forth, so it's not like one meaningful product in and of itself. It's a lot of different services that is stitched together and provide more like an experience, I would say. We try to be open about different operators and stuff that we create. As a standalone thing, it's not necessarily super meaningful and it's to consumers, basically. FRODE SUNDBY: But we still want to do everything we build. We want to build it in the open because, as we said, we are paid by the Norwegian government, which in turn is paid for by the Norwegian people. So the things that we build, do it in the open. We're not trying to hide what we're doing. This is what we are doing with the Norwegian money. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, I think that's very unique to Scandinavia in general but I guess to particularly in Norway and NAV. I remember having a very good experience from that meetup. The next question is, what's going on with NAIS? What does the future look like for you? JOHNNY HORVI: So it's quite a lot of things happening right now. The current primary focus is based around cost and providing our developers with insight as to how what their workloads are driving, of course, how much is the compute, how much is the database and the buckets that you're running and try to surface this in a good way to the developers. We do this through the NAIS console that Frode mentioned earlier. One thing is to provide the awareness of the actual costs because it's not free, and also in terms of insight into how good their utilization is. Because in the application spec, you define how much resources does my application need or you think it needs, but this is kind of a hard problem because it's not easy to know a prompt and it varies. And trying to provide, at least as a first step, the teams with tools in order to see how well it utilizes the resources that they've allocated is our start there so that they can see that. Yeah, I can probably use 1/10 of what I've actually requested, for instance. FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah, that's the cost aspect of the console. We also want to use the console to improve the developer experience. As it is now, we've been given a lot the functionality for free. We've built operators saying that, OK, just give us an application specification and we will make the Kubernetes resources for you. But then day two operation, you will have to use kubectl and you would have to go into the cluster and suddenly, you as a developer need to understand a lot of how Kubernetes works. Oh, suddenly there's a deployment here. What is a deployment? What is a pod? How do I check the logs? Ah, OK, so there's suddenly this whole new landscape which they need to figure out. And we've got around 400 developers. And giving 400 developers kubectl and teaching them Kubernetes. Yes, we could do that and we have been doing that, but they don't necessarily need to understand all of this because we can take the relevant information for them and just display it in the console. We're not taking away kubectl from the developers, but we're just taking the relevant parts and making it even more accessible so that they don't have to. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, just making it easier basically for people to figure out what's going on. FRODE SUNDBY: Yep, absolutely. JOHNNY HORVI: Try to fade the implementation details into the background, allowing GCP and Kubernetes to fade a bit in the background. Yeah, wipe that. [LAUGHTER] FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah, just letting them because it turns out what they care most about is their application and not where the application runs, so, OK, let's give them what they need then. This is application-focused for them. Here is exactly what you are interested in about your application. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Nice. Any plans to have NAIS being part of the CNCF ecosystem, or is it not even like an ongoing discussion? JOHNNY HORVI: Not really a discussion we've had. Like I mentioned, it's like a collection of different operators and tools that is sewn together to provide a certain experience for our developers. And I'm not sure how it would kind of fit into the CNCF. I'm not sure if that makes sense in the collection of the tools. FRODE SUNDBY: It's not exactly a one-click install, nice, you've got your own platform running. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: I see. I mean, you'd be surprised how many projects that are part of the CNCF are. Because it feels to me like NAIS is actually not a specialized tool because it has multiple functionalities. And the whole ecosystem of CNCF is full of tools that does one thing. So I guess even if NAIS is not really, as you are describing it, like a one product, it's a combination of multiple products. If it's presented to people as further described like the golden path and according to golden path, what are the tools you need, that could actually be a very cool, in my opinion, developer story just the way I see it. FRODE SUNDBY: Huh. JOHNNY HORVI: Yeah, it's entirely possible to maybe imagine a way that it could be stitched more together and be provided as a whole product. FRODE SUNDBY: As you said, NAV is a general tool, and that is actually quite true. It's a general tool for solving general problems. And when we started building this in 2016, we saw that, yeah, we are trying to solve the problems of the developers at NAV. And being then in the public platform forums, we've seen that all the other public agencies are trying to solve the same problems using the same-ish tools. So in, I think it was 2021 perhaps, we saw that, OK, what we've built here is not unique to NAV. It can work for everyone else as well. So this is when we started to say that, OK, here is NAIS. We can provide it for other public agencies as well. We built some tools to make sure that we could set it up in other public agencies Google organization and just terraform it up and they've got their own NAIS asset service. JOHNNY HORVI: Yeah, I was actually looking what you were talking of looking at the website. I like the URL. It's naas.nais.io, which I guess stands for NAIS as a service. FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah, that's great. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: [LAUGHS] So, yeah, it might be a little bit confusing in this whole conversation because we're sometimes saying NAIS too much on the platform or just nice to say nice things. So I think people will have to figure out which one we're mentioning. But for the reference, the website is NAIS, nais.io. The documentation is there. You can check it out. I looked at the quickstart guide. It looked pretty straightforward. So if you are listening to this episode and you want to try it out, knock yourself down, I guess. All right, well, thank you very much, Johnny and Frode. FRODE SUNDBY: Yeah, thank you. JOHNNY HORVI: Thank you. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Thank you for the time. I appreciate you talking to me. And I hope you enjoyed the episode. And until next time. [MUSIC PLAYING] KASLIN FIELDS: Thank you for that interview, Abdel. That was really interesting. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, it was indeed. I got to know these people when-- actually, I don't know if you remember this, but the Twitter account of NAIS reached out to our Twitter account when we got the show. KASLIN FIELDS: Oh, yeah, yeah. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Right? KASLIN FIELDS: Mhm. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: And they were like, hey, it would be awesome to come on the show and talk about what we do. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: And it only took us a year to do it. KASLIN FIELDS: It only took us a year. We got around to it eventually. We're figuring stuff out. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Exactly. KASLIN FIELDS: They have such a great story, though. I feel like it's like what I want most stories to be generally in this space where, like, we have a problem and we figured out how we're going to solve it with Kubernetes, and our focus is on making developers' lives easier, and they just did that. And then I think it makes it really cool that they have all of these different government agencies and they've created this one solution that solves the 80% problem, like you all were saying. And then just all of the government agencies in Norway seem to just use it now. That's crazy to me. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yes. And they are using public cloud and they are doing everything in the public as a government agency, which is like an extra level of cool, I guess. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah. So many problems with that for folks who work in other government agencies, I'm sure. I'm sure a lot of them are jealous right now. [LAUGHS] ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah. I guess also during the question about \"what does NAV do,\" I don't remember which one of-- it was Johnny or Frode who was talking about the fact that it is a welfare agency sounds like a deranged kind of concept. But then it's that and then they're doing stuff in the cloud is like an extra layer of, what's going on. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: But, yeah, it was pretty interesting to see like, as you said, they came from the JBoss and web servers old-school way and then they straight into Kubernetes after meeting Kelsey. And then they realized-- I guess one of the-- part of the conversation was, like, most of the developers need the same thing. Like, no one has unique use cases. Everybody pretty much just needs to run an app and write data somewhere. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah. And something that I really loved about your conversation is that I feel like it speaks to one of the core tenants of security, actually, which is that-- I mean, essentially, everything in security is trying to keep people from doing things they shouldn't be doing, which you do by making those things as hard as you possibly can, basically. Right? ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Or the other way of looking at it is abstracting away the complexity from people. KASLIN FIELDS: For the positive path, for the path that you want them to go on. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yes. KASLIN FIELDS: Which is what they're doing here is they're taking that concept and applying it to say, well, we want people to do this, we made it as easy as possible for them to do it and that's what they do. So that's a really good story. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, it's pretty cool. Yeah, and then we met again-- so the story of how this whole interview came to be is they reached out to us on Twitter. They were somewhere in our backlog. We didn't really get time to get to it. And it took me all the way until I went to JavaZone, which is a conference in Norway in September last year, and I met the people from NAV because they were a sponsor for that conference. And then I saw people wearing these T-shirts that says \"NAV,\" and I was like, oh, yeah, I heard about you guys, what's going on? KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah, let's talk. [LAUGHS] ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Let's talk, yeah. And then we started chatting and then I realized, oh, we actually do have a relationship with them because they're a customer. And, I mean, that's not the reason why we brought them on the show just because they happen to be a customer. It doesn't really matter. And then I ended up talking to these two folks, which was cool. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah. And I'm excited to do more of that hopefully here in 2024. Looking forward to conferences already. So hoping that we can meet a lot of you out there and you can come up to us and tell us about your story so that we can learn more. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, that's actually a good call for action. If you are doing something cool with Kubernetes, come talk to us. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah, especially KubeCon EU, we're doing all sorts of gearing up for that right now. So if you're going to be there, make sure you come and find us. We'll be around. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, we have stickers, by the way. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah, we have stickers. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: We have, like, 3,000 of them. KASLIN FIELDS: We have so many stickers. [LAUGHTER] ABDEL SGHIOUAR: That'll be nice. KASLIN FIELDS: Awesome. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Awesome. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah. So one other thing I guess I'll mention about this is that one thing you all talked about is that it's basically just a collection of operators is what NAIS is. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Pretty much. KASLIN FIELDS: And so it's not like one thing that you just deploy, that was like a whole conversation that you all had. But with the whole story that they told about how this makes their processes so much easier, I'm really curious about how they do the database bit, like, how they integrate their operators into the whole workflow and everything. So I'm probably going to go look around at those operators a little bit more. So if you are interested in joining me in looking at those operators, we'll have some links in the show notes to all of the resources. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yes, we'll make sure to include all of the resources there. KASLIN FIELDS: Awesome. Thank you so much, Abdel. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Thank you.

I'm your host, Kaslin Fields. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: And I'm Abdel Sghiouar. [MUSIC PLAYING] KASLIN FIELDS: This week, we spoke to Bill Mulligan. Bill is a Community Pollinator at Isovalent and works on Cilium and eBPF. We learned how to properly pronounce Isovalent and what it actually means. We also spoke in depth about eBPF, Cilium, network function in Kubernetes, and more. But first, let's get to the news. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: The legacy Linux package repositories, apt.kubernetes.io and yum.kubernetes.io, AKA, packages.cloud.google.com, have been frozen starting from September 13, 2023 and are going away in January 2024. If you run your own Kubernetes clusters, you must make sure your clusters are set up to pull from the active community-owned repository, packages.k8s.io. Make sure to check out the blog from the Kubernetes community in the show notes to learn more. KASLIN FIELDS: Kubernetes 1.29 is now available on GKE in the Rapid channel. Google Cloud customers can start experimenting with the new version of Kubernetes to find any backward compatibility issues that might occur. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: VMware announced the Tanzu Application catalog is fully compliant with the supply chain levels of Software Artifacts Level 3 Security, or SALSA. The application is the enterprise version of Bitnami app catalog available on the Tanzu platform. AWS announced the pricing for extended support of Kubernetes minor versions on EKS. Starting April 1, 2024, EKS clusters running versions in the extended support window will be charged $0.60 per cluster per hour. KASLIN FIELDS: Clusters in standard support remain at $0.10 per cluster per hour. Extended support is a feature of EKS which gives customers an extra 12 months of support for minor Kubernetes versions. In other terms, if you run in the extended support window of EKS, you will pay more for the support provided by AWS. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: The Kubernetes Contributor Summit Paris will happen on March 19, 2024. The CFP four planned sessions is open to contributors and will close on Sunday, February 4. KASLIN FIELDS: The agenda for KubeCon and CloudNativeCon co-located events is live. You can start building your agenda today for the 15 events happening on Tuesday, March 19th, 2024 in Paris. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: The cloud native glossary is now available in French. The glossary is a CNCF-led project that aims to explain cloud native concepts in simple language and is translated into 12 languages beside English. KASLIN FIELDS: Blixt, which means \"lightning\" in Swedish, however it may be pronounced, is the name of an experimental layer for load balancer for Kubernetes. The project originated at Kong and was donated to Kubernetes' SIG network in 2022. The control plane is built on the gateway API using Go. The data plane uses eBPF and is written in Rust. There's a new blog post about Blixt from the Kubernetes community, which you can find the link to in the show notes. And that's the news. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Today, I'm with Bill Mulligan. Bill is a Community Builder at Isovalent, which I am going to count on you to tell me how to pronounce it, actually. And you are also a committer to Cilium. You run a very popular newsletter on LinkedIn, which I'm subscribed to. It's called \"eCHO News,\" which is a biweekly publication on everything eBPF and Cilium. Welcome to the show, Bill. BILL MULLIGAN: Thanks for having me. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: We were chatting before we started the recording, and you are from Wisconsin, right? BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, that's correct. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Tell us something fun, something people don't know about you. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, so the big stereotype about Wisconsin is that it's like the biggest producer of cheese in America, and I guess the fun facts that I have is at my high school, we had Drive your Tractor to School Day. And my uncle owned 8,000 cows, so all the stereotypes are true. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: OK, sure. I didn't say anything. You said it. All right. So I've never been to Wisconsin. I hope I can visit it at some point. So all the stuff I know about Wisconsin are American stand-up comedians making fun of Wisconsin. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, pretty much. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: And cheese is one of them, so. All right, so cheese aside, let's get going. So we're here today to talk about eBPF, which I'm actually very excited to learn about because it have been a big subject of discussion/debate in the cloud native community. One of the reasons why I actually wanted to have you on the show is to have somebody who could really make us make sense of all this these technologies. But before we get going, tell us a little bit how did you got into cloud native. Where does it all started? BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, so my background is probably a little bit different than a lot of people in the industry. I actually did my undergrad in biochemistry, and then I did a master's in social science. And I would say I kind of accidentally fell into cloud native. I was looking for a job after grad school and just applying to a bunch of different startups because that's the people that employ people who have no other skills. And so I got into this four-person company that was doing machine learning platform on Kubernetes, and I was really excited because I thought Kubernetes was, like, some great Greek island and that's where the company office were going to be. But then the first day at work, they sat me down with my Windows laptop, and they're like, you're going to set up a Kubernetes cluster. And this is, like, Kubernetes 1.8 or something, and so I'd never seen the command line before. And yeah, it took me eight hours, but I had a working Kubernetes cluster by the end of the day. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Nice, nice. It sounds like your origin story is kind of similar to mine. My first job, my interview was, set up a ticketing system based on open tickets, which is like an open source ticketing system, and then OpenERP, which today people call Odoo, which is like an ERP thing. So it was like, hey, sit down. If, by the end of the day, you manage to figure this out, you have a job. So yeah, it was interesting. Then you fall into it, and then how did you started contributing to open source? What was your-- what do you do with open source stuff? BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, so I think this is also funny for me. My first contribution was actually just fixing a broken link in the Kubernetes documentation, so Kubernetes sync docs has a lot of great work. I think by getting people into the community, even if they don't stick around like me, I made that contribution, and then I think I've made one other contribution to Kubernetes but haven't been back since. But now I'm a maintainer of another project in the cloud native ecosystem, so from the first small change of just fixing a broken link to a maintainer. And I think it's great when people start small with open source. You don't need to try to boil the whole cloud native ocean. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, and you certainly do not need to start contributing code. Documentation is a very good way to get started. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, absolutely. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: I would even go further and say it's a very welcome contribution because I don't think a lot of developers actually like writing documentation, so if you are able to help out, people will appreciate that. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, definitely. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Awesome, awesome. All right. So then I guess you worked a bunch of companies before Isovalent, where you are right now, which is very known for, A, having a very hard name to pronounce-- and probably no one understands what it means-- and, B, pushing very hard on Cilium and eBPF. So let's start with the beginning. How do you pronounce the name of your company? BILL MULLIGAN: I'm actually very impressed with your pronunciation. I would say Isovalent, which is very close to you. I've also heard eeso-valent and other iterations, but yeah, Isovalent. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: OK. I guess probably the people who would say eeso-valence are maybe French speakers because I-S-O in French is written iso, which is the standard, like the iso plus a number. But I speak two other languages, so that's probably why. And I think I heard it pronounced before in a conference, so that's probably how I know it. So what does actually \"isovalent\" mean, the word? BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, so the company actually wasn't originally named Isovalent. The original name of the company was Covalent, and this comes from chemistry, actually, when you have covalent bonds, and this is bonds between two atoms that are really strong. And actually, if you look at the original Cilium logo, you kind of see this covalent bond in the logo. Now, the project logo and the company name have been updated, so isovalent is very similar. You can also have isovalent bonds, and so that's where the pronunciation comes from too. So it's kind of this chemistry background of how do we connect things together, and that plays into everything that Cilium does today is really connecting our cloud native infrastructure. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Makes a lot of sense. All right. That means for the people who are going to transcript our episode, they will have to get it correctly and then for us we will have to go do some digging to find some chemistry Wikipedia pages to add to the show notes so people understand what you're talking about. Cool. And so since I joined cloud native, eBPF have always been in the picture, and the only thing I know is eBPF comes from something that was called BPF before, without the E, which stands for Berkeley Packet Filtering, which was supposed to be a replacement of Iptables. I might be wrong. So what is eBPF? Help us get the 101 kind of level of understanding? BILL MULLIGAN: eBPF is this Linux Kernel technology, and what it allows you to do is to run, essentially, specified programs in the Linux Kernel when certain event happens, so that's kind of like the very low-level explanation of what eBPF is. Taking it up a level, the thing that a lot of people like to do is eBPF is to the Kernel what JavaScript is to the browser, and so that kind of example you kind of get, right? Before we had static web pages. And then JavaScript comes along, and suddenly, we can have interactive elements that kind of respond to user input. And that's a little bit what eBPF is doing in the Kernel. An event happens, and then you can run a program that changes what's happening in the Kernel. And then taking it up one more level, a really more abstract analogy that I sometimes like to use is eBPF is like the cloud native app store. So cell phones originally, when you had your brick phone, came with whatever software or programs were delivered by the device manufacturer. Then Apple came along with the iPhone, and there was an app store. And you could download new programs to add functionality on the fly for whatever you needed. So you're like, OK, I need to navigate around where I am. So I download Google Maps. I need to order food. I download Deliveroo. And so you can add new functionality to this existing hardware as you need it on the fly, and that's what eBPF allows you to do. You're adding new programs, new functionality to the Linux Kernel when you need them, and you're able to run them, update them, and do this all in a safe, secure, and performant manner. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Awesome. I really like this analogy, actually. I really like the analogy of the browser-- JavaScript is to the browser what eBPF is to the Kernel. But let me get this in my own words. So when you say \"events,\" that's essentially-- in Kernel terminology, that's syscalls, right? BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Or that's things that the programs or apps running on the Kernel are trying to do. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, exactly, so syscalls could be one example or different trace points within the Kernel, so whenever different things happen within the Kernel, yeah. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Got it. And then is eBPF more the framework and the runtime sandbox-type thing, or is it just one of those things? BILL MULLIGAN: eBPF is actually made up of a lot of different components, and I would recommend checking out ebpf.io. It has an explanation of what eBPF is. But essentially, walking through what it is, first you're going to have your eBPF program, and eBPF programs are written by developers. These are then going to be loaded into the Kernel, usually by a library. So for example, Cilium has an eBPF go library that we use the Kernel is then going to go through a process of verification, and this verification step is actually really important for the eBPF because it essentially ensures the safety of the Linux Kernel. This is kind of like the critical component of your operating system, so you don't you want to make sure it doesn't crash or stall the Kernel. So the verifier makes sure that the programs run to completion, it's not accessing memory it isn't supposed to, essentially that these programs are going to be safe for your Linux Kernel to run. Then it's going to be compiled to the architecture, so it basically runs as fast as natively-compiled Kernel code, and then it's going to be essentially loaded into your Kernel. And so then it's a sandbox program running into the Kernel. But the great thing about eBPF is it provides a really low overhead way of doing this because this program isn't just something that's running all the time, running in the background. It's only running, essentially, when a specific event that triggers it happens, and so you have these really low overhead way of doing new things in the Kernel. And since it's running in the Kernel, it has access to a lot of things that aren't available to programs just running in user space too. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Got it. Yeah, so that's a very, very good explanation in the sense that basically whatever the Kernel executes, you can hook up kind of like a program to it and then make the program do certain things for you, either modify things or maybe even observability. I know that one of the features of Cilium is observability, which relies on eBPF. And then you can go some-- you can get some super fine-grained observability that you cannot get from, let's say, the HTTP stack or the TCP stack or whatever. OK, so that's cool. So then that's basically explaining what's eBPF, but what eBPF today, in 2024? I guess my question is, help people make a sense of, as a developer, should I care, shouldn't I care? Will I ever have to use eBPF? Will I ever have to use-- [? a ?] [? reason ?] [? to ?] [? care. ?] There is a library that uses eBPF. Is this something that people have to be exposed to, or, let's say, I don't know, 99% of people shouldn't care? BILL MULLIGAN: So I would say it's both, like any good answer. It depends. So what eBPF is in 2024-- and maybe I'll start with, first, why are people talking about it so much, and why has it become a hot technology right now? ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Cool. BILL MULLIGAN: And when we're thinking about the cloud native revolution, things are happening a lot faster, they're a lot more dynamic, and we need to essentially design infrastructure for different scale, a different speed than we were doing previously. It's kind of like this whole, also, pets-to-cattle analogy too. We're using from things that we can maintain individually and by themselves to groups of things. And so what eBPF allows us to do is to add new functionality because what people may not realize about the Linux Kernel is that it's a 30-year-old technology, and it's kind of accumulated a lot of things in 30 years. And the other thing is Linux is deployed on literally billions of devices worldwide right, and so if you want to make a change to the upstream community, you have to get it accepted by the whole community, and it has to be acceptable to run on those billions of devices. And so since this is such a critical component of basically all modern computing, it takes a long time to bring things into production, and so if you have an idea of, hey, I'd like to add this new functionality to the Linux Kernel, first you have to convince the Linux Kernel community that it's a good idea, get it merged upstream. And then once it's merged upstream, it's in the latest Linux Kernel release, and to get it into a long-term supported release by your vendor that you're using or that's approved by compliance, that may take, actually, a couple of years. So this new functionality isn't something that you can have tomorrow. It's something that can take literally a couple of years to actually reach end users, and eBPF really changes this whole paradigm. You can sit down, write an eBPF program, adding this new functionality load it into your Kernel on the fly. Making eBPF verify it ensures that it's not going to crash in Kernel, and once you have this new functionality in your Kernel, you're able to change essentially what the Linux Kernel is doing. And Brendan Gregg, who is a person who popularized a lot of stuff around eBPF, gave a talk at the last eBPF Summit about Fast by Friday, and he's talking about how he could literally be in meetings with customers, and they were asking questions about the performance of their systems. He could write a eBPF program in the meeting and show them the actual data by the end of the meeting. That's the difference, days, hours, rather than years. And I think that's why eBPF is becoming so important and interesting right now, because in the cloud native world, things move quickly, and eBPF allows us to keep up with that speed of change. And I guess the real question is whether you should care about it. Should everybody go start programming eBPF programs tomorrow? And this, I think, also depends too, like any good answer, but I think the answer for most people is actually probably no. And I think this may be a little bit controversial. People like to get their hands on with the newest, the latest technology, but the same thing that we were seeing with Linux Kernel development before, a lot of specialized companies, people like Google, deploy a team of Linux Kernel developers so that they can make the modifications that they need right and maybe even maintain their own Kernel. But most companies are going to take either a regular release from one of the distributions or run something from their vendor of choice, and that's because they don't have this expertise to be able to do that. But they're still using Linux as this underlying technology that they're relying on, and I think we're going to see the same thing with eBPF. People that are really specialized in this are going to be writing eBPF programs. It's going to be providing a lot of functionality, a lot of benefits in terms of performance, scalability, time to market. But in terms of actually programming eBPF, most companies aren't going to have to worry about that. And I actually think, in some ways, that's a good thing because you get the advantage of this technology without having to become an expert in it. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Got it. BILL MULLIGAN: Right. And that's kind of what we like about advanced technologies. There's the quote, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" And I think that's what eBPF is going to provide to a lot of people, this magical experience of getting this new functionality in the Linux Kernel, providing something like faster networking, better observability, more secure systems, essentially tomorrow for free. And that's a great benefit, and they don't have to know how it works all under the hood. But they still get the benefits of this technology. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Got it. But that's good, and the analogy or the example I would give here-- and I'm realizing I'm going to give a product pitch, but whatever-- is the GKE Dataplane Version 2, which we talked about on Twitter, the new functionality we added where we replaced the old CNI we had GKE with Cilium. And we were able to instantly give people network policy login because before, network policy couldn't debug it because there is no logs, and so now we just added this new functionality, and for most people, they shouldn't care that it's there. They just need to know, OK, well you annotate your network policy, and then, boom, we can generate logs for you. And that helps further debugging or troubleshooting if network policies are actually working or not working right because I know that one of the probably big things in Kubernetes is that no one really likes how network policies are written. They are really a pain to write and understand. So that's a good way to describe it in the sense that a lot of people will just have to install something, enable something, and in your analogy, you used [? \"download ?] an app from the marketplace,\" and then, boom, they have the functionality without having to even care about it. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, exactly. It's like the same way you don't care what language your app on your phone is written in right. People aren't going to care like whether something is written with Iptables or eBPF. They're going to look for the actual end-user benefits. Does this provide me faster networking? Is this easier to debug? And I think projects and products that are leveraging eBPF are going eventually went out in the end because of these benefits that essentially come with eBPF itself. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Awesome. Cool. OK, we'll move forward toward-- the other thing that your company does is Cilium, right? So I went and scooped around a little bit in the Isovalent website and clicked on the products, and there's like a long list of functionalities that Cilium can do. In my head-- and again, maybe I'm too dumb to follow up-- Cilium is a CNI. That's how I know it. So what is Cilium today? What can people do with Cilium? BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, so if you go to cilium.io, you'll see the headlines. It says \"eBPF-powered networking observability and security.\" And that's what it does-- networking security and observability, which-- obviously, all really broad buckets. But I think if we dive into each of those, we can kind of trace the history and the development of the Cilium project and kind of understand how it came to be and why it is the way today. So you're right. Cilium originally started just as a CNI, so a way to connect containers together, and that was back in 2015. I think one of the things that a lot of people maybe don't realize about Cilium is that it's actually quite an old project at this point. It's going to be going on nine years now? ABDEL SGHIOUAR: So it's one year younger than Kubernetes itself. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, exactly, so it's been around for a long time and kind of seen a lot of developments. And I think the project has really grown with the needs of the cloud native industry as a whole too. And so it began first as this connectivity layer, connecting containers together. Then the next thing that people start to ask for is, how do we secure this? This is where network policy comes in. If all of-- in a world of microservices, everything's flowing over the network, so we need to be able to secure this. That's where the first part of security comes [? in too. ?] Then the next part is around observability. If all of our traffic is flowing over the network, what happens when things break if we need to debug something? And this is where Hubble was launched, and Hubble provides you network observability. Basically, what it does is it attaches onto Cilium, pulls all the information off of Cilium so that you're able to see things like a service map. You're able to pull network metrics out of there and have observability of, is this thing connected or is it not? And then as we see the development of the industry from single clusters to multiclusters, Cilium added things like multicluster mesh, being able to provide a consistent layer to tie everything together. And then I think now we've gotten to a point in the industry where cloud native really isn't just about Kubernetes. It's about being able to extend to things outside of Kubernetes too, and so this is when we started to get things like Cilium Mesh, so providing transit gateways to virtual machines, bare metal machines. And then I think \"mesh\" is a very overloaded term, but there's also Cilium Service Mesh, which kind of does this exact same thing, connecting, securing, and observing everything. And I think a lot of people tie service mesh with these terms too, but I think, different from a lot of service meshes, Cilium kind of goes from the bottom up, from layer three, layer four, controlling all of the network packets, up towards layer seven. And I think that's the thing that's exciting for me about Cilium Service Mesh is really connecting, securing, and observing everything that's happening. And in, I guess, the world of distributed computing, everything's going over the network, so it really is the most critical layer in your infrastructure stack today. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah. I think it's important to acknowledge, as you rightfully mentioned, that service mesh is an overloaded term, and that's because probably-- because Istio was the first project, open source project, to introduce this concept of service mesh, in people's heads it just stuck with how Istio does things. But that's not necessarily the case for other service meshes. I remember looking at Linkerd. I looked also at not Cilium, but I looked at the other one. There is one which is open source, very popular. At some point, HashiCorp released their Consul service mesh. So I was looking at those, and I was realizing, OK, well, the way-- the service mesh architecture in Istio is very specific to Istio, and that's not necessarily how all the other tools doing service mesh work. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, I would say this is actually a really funny thing about like Cilium Service Mesh. Cilium Service Mesh, when we kind of were thinking about it and we looked around-- what does a service mesh mean today? What are all the functionalities? And the Cilium project itself, before we launched the official Cilium Service Mesh, already had kind of 80% of the functionality of a service mesh, things like connecting things together, connecting multiple clusters together, providing that observability component, providing some type of network security too. And there's only a couple of things around neutral authentication that were actually added to make it the official Cilium service mesh. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Got it. BILL MULLIGAN: I'm kind of biased here. I've written some articles that I think, in the future, we're actually going to see like the whole service mesh terminology just kind of disappear right because these are things that we were doing before, connecting things together, observing how they work, providing security for them. These are all part of the networking layer itself. I don't think it needs to be a whole separate category. It's part of what we do. We're already doing it. I think we originally came up with the service mesh term to help us understand these for like the cloud native world, but as we've advanced so much in the past eight, nine years, I think we've learned a lot, and we're able to take those learnings and integrate them back. And I think this is a really important thing if we want to move the industry forward because I think at this point, we've seen Kubernetes has a lot of mainstream adoption, and we need to-- it's not-- the new use cases connecting back to the rest of our IT infrastructure, and a big part of that is educating and helping other people understand how their world connects to the cloud native world. And we need to be able to translate that terminology from cloud native back into the rest of our infrastructure. Some people in the networking world-- this is people who are working with hardware switches, the Cisco switches, are doing things with BGP. How do they connect to the cloud native world? Well, we need to explain things in their terminology, and I think we're going to see a lot of that going forwards. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: I don't think that you mentioned in the fact that the service mesh will disappear as a term as it probably will become like a native feature into Kubernetes itself maybe going further. I don't think that that's neither a hot take nor a biased thing. I think that the way Kubernetes itself is progressing is going in a sense that a lot of things that used to be a big deal a few years ago now are just available in the platform, and no one cares about them. And that's, in my opinion, one of the best things in Kubernetes as a project. It's being able to like provide you with that abstraction layer that what you used to care about-- I don't know. People used to care about jobs, and the [? job ?] API was a big deal a few years ago. Now it's just there. No one cares. It's whatever. You just write a job. You write a cron, and it just works. So in that sense, yeah, service mesh not becoming a big deal, and the functionalities just being part of the platform is, as you said, probably going to make it such a way that no one will care about service mesh at all in the future. And in that sense, I might be considering myself a visionary because I wrote that [? \"you ?] probably don't need a service mesh\" talk a couple of times, which goes in the sense of like explaining to people that, yeah, your CISO reading a white paper that says \"service mesh is a big deal.\" That's not how you should reason or think about it. You shouldn't implement it just because everybody is doing it. You should implement it because you know what it does. Cool. Well, that's just a long rant. Anyway, I want to move further to the next part of my question. So eBPF and Cilium-- how are they connected? And what's the relationship between these two things? BILL MULLIGAN: It's similar to what we were just talking about, about this abstraction layer. So I would say that Cilium in some ways is an abstraction layer on eBPF. So eBPF is kind of all these programs running in the Kernel, but you need a way to manage that to do what you want to do. And rather than writing bytecode or programming eBPF program, Cilium allows you to write things in YAML. And so you can say, connect these two containers. This container shouldn't talk to that container. Tell me what our network traffic looks like in your YAML definitions rather than having to write the eBPF programs. So what Cilium essentially does is there is a Cilium agent that's installed as a DaemonSet on every single node in your cluster, and what that's responsible for is loading and unloading these eBPF programs that are doing the networking, the observability, and the security in your cluster. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Got it. Got it. So essentially, Cilium uses eBPF for part of the features it's able to provide. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, essentially all of the features are-- the vast majority of the features in Cilium are done through eBPF. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Got it. So does that mean that people would be able to probably-- if they still want to have the option to write their own programs and run them as part of Cilium, is there an API to extend Cilium itself? BILL MULLIGAN: You can run programs on nodes that are also running Cilium if you want to do different things or you want to collect different metrics than Cilium is doing, and we see people doing that right now. So I think one thing that's kind of interesting-- Cilium was one of the first applications leveraging eBPF, and we're starting to see more and more of them. And one of the interesting things in the eBPF ecosystem is now how do we manage all of these eBPF programs in a sensible and reasonable way. So similar to Kubernetes is managing the life cycle of all these containers that are suddenly appearing on our infrastructure I think in the same way we're going to have to figure out how we deal with the whole life cycle and, let's say, orchestration of these eBPF programs running on your Linux node. The Kernel community is still discussing how this is going to happen, and I don't think this is a finished discussion. We're kind of at the start, not the end. But I think this is a really interesting area for the whole eBPF community right now. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Got it, yeah. Now at least I can confidently say I understand what eBPF and Cilium are, so thank you for all these explanations. That's amazing. So Cilium is now a CNCF project, right? BILL MULLIGAN: Yep. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: At what level? Has it graduated sandbox? BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, it just graduated last year. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Graduated last year, cool. So is Isovalent still one of the biggest contributors to it or like are there other people? Because I know that there are other companies also offering manage stuff around Cilium, right? BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, Isovalent is the main contributor, and I actually have the annual report from Cilium. Every year we kind of do a summary of what's happened in the community, and you can link it in the show notes too. And the top five contributing companies by number of PRs were Isovalent, Independent, Red Hat, VMware, and Google. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: OK, cool. Yeah, because I remember that we mentioned the report in our last episode, in the news portion, because I saw it on the CNCF website's blog, but I didn't read the details. OK, so you are still one of the main contributors. OK, so then we talked about eBPF. We talked about Cilium. We talked about Kubernetes and the ecosystem and all this cloud native stuff. Then Isovalent is the company that provides manage offering around this, right? BILL MULLIGAN: So we provide a enterprise distribution of Cilium. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: OK, enterprise distribution. So it's like the freemium model. You have the open source, which you can use, but then if you need more features or technical support, you can go to Isovalent. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, exactly. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Cool. And I know that's one of the things that I have seen-- and I also replied to one of the posts on LinkedIn-- was the CCA, which is the Cilium Certified Associate. For those of you who doesn't know, I can see their certificates like Pokemons. I just want to have them all. So what's that? Are you involved in that project? BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, so I've been involved in that project too. This is a new certification from the Linux Foundation similar to the CKA, CKAD, KCNA if you want to keep on going with the alphabet soup here. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yes, the ICA, the Istio one. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, exactly. So the CCA is a new certification from the Linux Foundation focused specifically on Cilium, and it's an entry-level certification basically to test your knowledge, like, do you know what Cilium is, do you know like the different features, and things like that. And so I'll just walk through the general like components of the exam so people can learn more about it. So the first part is installation and configuration. The second part is the architecture of Cilium. Then it goes into network policy-- so how do you secure your network-- service mesh, network observability with Hubble and the service mesh, cluster mesh, a basic understanding of eBPF, things like BGP and external networking. So it covers a wide range of different topics on there. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Cool. It's worth mentioning that as of now that we're recording this, the exam is in beta. You have to sign up to get it. I replied to Chris, the CTO of the CNCF to say \"I want to be in,\" and I guess there was a conversation going on in LinkedIn between yourself, myself, and then somebody also from Isovalent where we shared some resources around how to prepare for it, which we'll make sure to include in the show notes, right? BILL MULLIGAN: Yep. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Anything else you want to mention about the certification? Is it worth people's time? Should people go look at it? BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, it was done by a lot of people across the community, so lots of great questions. I know there's a lot of experts on that. I think a lot of it was driven by my colleague, Nico, and he does a lot of great content around Cilium. Shadrach on my team also came up with a CCA study guide that you can find on GitHub, so I'd recommend checking that out. I'm sure it'll be in the show notes. And if you want to catch them all for, I guess, certs around Cilium, I'd also recommend going to the Isovalent website. We actually have a lot of labs-- and these are hands-on demo environments-- going through, essentially, all the different features about Cilium. And people really like love them, and a lot of people are trying to collect them all. And my colleague, Raphael, also created a whole world of Cilium thing that will take you to the different parts of the project. And you can do labs, and track your progress, kind of going through the whole world of Cilium. So there's a lot of cool resources to check out if you want to learn more about the project after this podcast. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah. Awesome, yeah, we'll make sure to include all the links. I think-- I see certifications, beyond the Pokemon joke, as just a great way to learn things and stay on top of the game and also to test your knowledge, so I think it's worth it. So just make sure to check it out. It's in beta. And also, it's worth mentioning that when certifications are being developed by the Linux Foundation, they do actually use the community to help write questions, so if you are interested, there are ways to actually get involved in these things. Cool. So we're getting close to almost the end of our conversation here, but I still wanted to mention some news from, I think, late last year. You got acquired by Cisco. BILL MULLIGAN: We did. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: And it's funny that you mentioned earlier that you're trying to bridge the gap between cloud native networking and then the Cisco switch-based hardware networking world. I'm coming from that world, by the way, FYI. That's what I did in a previous life. So what's that? What does that mean, actually, for Isovalent? BILL MULLIGAN: I think it makes me more excited about the future for Cilium. I think in the cloud native world, Cilium has become the default option for all the major public cloud, providers basically every single Kubernetes distribution, literally hundreds of end users from all different scales, across every single industry. Cilium has become the standard in the cloud native world. I think this acquisition by Cisco really signifies that Cilium is becoming the future of networking. I think Cisco, as this networking giant, saying, we think Cilium is the future, I think is a really big statement for where the project is heading to. And it's kind of looking around like, who hasn't said Cilium is the future for networking? And there's not that many people left. So it makes me really excited about the future of the project. In terms of what does it mean for Isovalent, it means we have more resources, more people, more of everything to continue investing in the Cilium project, so I'm super excited about where the project is going. I know there's a lot of people over at Cisco, like Stephen Augustus, heading up the open source program office there, and they're looking to do a lot more in the cloud native community. And so I think this is a really exciting time to come in there and really build the momentum even more behind the Cilium project. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, as we were talking, actually, I was thinking in my head. Before advocacy, I was doing consulting, and a big part of any migration project to the cloud, when you work with major companies that already have their on-premise systems and they are looking into either extending to the cloud to use more stuff in the cloud or just completely migrating, part of what we call the foundational job, the foundational work you have to do is disconnecting the cloud to on-premise. And I remember from that time, when I didn't even knew Cilium existed, a lot of times it's discussions that are more tailored toward the old school, if I dare say it this way. It was like VPNs and routers and stuff like that. And I do see Cisco coming and acquiring a cloud native company is a very good indicator of the maturity of the project and also probably an indicator of the future, if I dare make a prediction, that networking will just become easier. And it's like, being able to-- because yeah, one of the things that Cilium does is-- it's YAML file-based, so you just write a YAML file. And then you guys wrote code that translates YAML file into low-level IPs and TCP sessions and firewalls and all that stuff that 99% of developers shouldn't even care about. So going further, being able to interconnect these traditional networking and cloud native networking is super-exciting, in my opinion, future to look for. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, I think that's the future that we're looking at too, and it kind of goes back to what I was talking about before as, how can we make sure that we bring the rest of it into or at least connected to the cloud native world? And I think this really positions us very well and the Cilium project as a whole kind of to be this bridge from cloud native to the rest of our IT infrastructure. And I think eBPF is becoming a key part of this too. My colleague, Dan Finneran, is doing a lot of fun stuff. I don't know if you've seen on Twitter. He recently did something about BGP in eBPF. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Oh, yes. I think I saw it, yeah. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, and I think we're going to see a lot more fun stuff like that coming out to making sure that, yeah, the networking does just work, rather than debugging late at night. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah. And actually, another thing I wanted to mention around eBPF-- and if anybody is wondering like how-- I don't think that anybody should be wondering the question of how mature this technology is because, again, as we said, it's existed for a while, but if anybody is still wondering, should this thing be a thing, should you care, I guess-- the way I like to describe it is, any technology, whenever the Java community starts caring about it, you know it's serious. Just context, a friend of mine called [? Mohammad ?] [? Abuleil ?] and another person-- I forgot his name-- are actually writing a library for Java for eBPF. So they are making it available to use eBPF from Java. And that's like, once Java cares, you know it's a big deal, so yeah. It's just-- this is not a joke. This is serious. Because if there is any constant in technology time, Java it is. So that's the only thing that's existed since probably most people my age, your age, and people around us have got into the technology space. Java was the first thing we heard. So yeah, if people-- if Java cares, that's a safe bet in terms of technology [? that cares, ?] I guess. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, absolutely. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Awesome. It was a pleasure talking to you. Thank you for all the explanations. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, and thank you for having me. It was really a fun conversation with you. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, it's like, you helped us explain eBPF and Cilium, so now next time somebody ask me what eBPF is, I will just point them to this episode and go like, go listen to what Bill has to say. BILL MULLIGAN: Oh, perfect. Thank you. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Awesome. Thank you very much, Bill. BILL MULLIGAN: Yeah, thank you. KASLIN FIELDS: Thank you so much for that interview, Abdel. It's always great to hear from Bill. He used to work for the CNCF if I recall correctly, so I met him through that. So it's always good to hear from him. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, I think he had some marketing chair position within the CNCF-- KASLIN FIELDS: Something like. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: --or was working-- yeah, yeah, I remember that from reading the LinkedIn profile. KASLIN FIELDS: Regardless, Bill is awesome, and you should totally follow the stuff that he does because he finds good things to be involved in my experience with him. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Definitely. KASLIN FIELDS: And we heard a little bit about that background in your interview as well. I didn't know that he had a background in biotech, which is something that I strongly considered going into and then ended up in tech through startups and doing Kubernetes. Love it. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, it's quite interesting. We were debating before the interview whether we should make the joke about Wisconsin and where he's from. And he was like, well, my uncle has cows. I was like, well, we should definitely talk about that then. KASLIN FIELDS: You've got to. You've got to talk about it. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: You got to talk about it, exactly. KASLIN FIELDS: My family actually raises cattle as well. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Really? Wow. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah, in Virginia just as kind of a small-time thing. But every time I go home-- last time I went home, my dad actually smoked a brisket that was from one of the cows that my uncle raised, so that was pretty cool. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Wow. All right. Maybe it's actually my retirement product, so let's see. KASLIN FIELDS: Good luck with that. I'm not doing that. Back to Cilium, though, and eBPF, something really interesting that I learned about Cilium from this is that it's only a year younger than Kubernetes itself, which I did not know. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, that's actually why in the interview I brought up this point of, what is Cilium beyond just the CNI? Because it was introduced as the CNI in 2015, so one year after Kubernetes, but then it just kept growing. So that's why I made sure to talk about-- OK, talk about Cilium outside of the CNI, and that's when we started talking about the service mesh and observability and all that stuff, right. KASLIN FIELDS: That's really impressive, and I'm surprised that it's that old. I can't believe that I didn't know that before now, but. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah. KASLIN FIELDS: But it never worked in a realm that was not containers it sounds like because things that early, like 2015-ish and earlier, it's like, a lot of those types of tools worked for things before containers started to become a thing but not Cilium. Cilium was geared toward containers the whole time it sounds like. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, it was pretty much a Kubernetes and containers thing. I think, over time, what's probably going to happen is, especially with the acquisition with Cisco, they're probably start building up stuff that are-- like in the interview, Bill talked about connecting your on-premise systems to your cloud native systems. So in your on-premise, you don't necessarily have containers in Kubernetes, so you might need to run stuff on VMs and things like that. So that probably would be the future because they're focusing quite a lot on this multicluster mesh kind of thing, right? KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah, he mentioned that extensibility, and I think he used the terminology of like Kubernetes dependencies, which-- I have all sorts of things I want to talk about there. But he mentioned that that was kind of the direction that Cilium was going in, which I find really interesting because I think that is a big trend, and I think you mentioned that in the interview as well, that Kubernetes over time has gathered up a lot of these functionalities that were outside of it but kind of didn't make sense outside of it over time. So it's definitely expanded to some degree, but I think that, going forward, it'll continue to be a big thing around like the things Kubernetes interacts with. That is often really the hard part of Kubernetes. The stuff within Kubernetes-- if it has the functionality that you need, that's great, and there's a lot that it does. But at some point, you go beyond the realm of Kubernetes itself, and you need some additional tools to help you out. And so Cilium is kind of focused in that space, which makes a lot of sense. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah. Before advocacy, when I was in consulting, Cilium was the number-one tool that customers were asking about all the time, way before even we introduced it to GKE in the form of Dataplane Version 2. KASLIN FIELDS: Interesting. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: So way before that was the case, people were asking us, can we actually buy Cilium enterprise or buy the actual enterprise support from Isovalent and just run it ourselves? And we do support it-- if you want to run it, you can-- because people wanted those extra functionalities. KASLIN FIELDS: Very interesting. And this kind of extension of Kubernetes of-- you get to a certain point in Kubernetes, and you're like, I need these things, and Kubernetes doesn't provide that. I used to talk about observability and a few security things, like MTLS and stuff. These are the kinds of things where I would talk about, here's service meshes, and they kind of fill these gaps. And you'll talk about the relationship between Cilium and service mesh a bit. And I'm not sure that I totally understood it, so being new to Cilium, which-- now I'm like, how have I avoided Cilium for this long? And I need to fix that. But so it sounds like Cilium is kind of service mesh-adjacent. Does it have its own service mesh thing? What is going on here exactly? ABDEL SGHIOUAR: So the easiest way to think about it is the following-- it has service mesh, but it's not service mesh that you might know if you think about service mesh in the context of Istio. KASLIN FIELDS: Service mesh is a broad field, huh? ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Correct. One of the conversations was about the fact that it's an overloaded term because the term \"service mesh\" was introduced by Istio based on how Istio was architected to work in the first place. But the term itself is generic, and it can mean whatever you want it to mean. So when Cilium came into the picture-- and to their credits, they're not trying to compete. They're not saying, oh, we're better than Istio or we can do what issue does. They're saying, we do service mesh the way we think it should be done, which is pretty cool. KASLIN FIELDS: Overloaded term. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Exactly, exactly. KASLIN FIELDS: I remember in, like, 2018-ish, when service mesh was the big thing that everyone was talking about, trying to explain it was always a challenge, and it sounds like it's kind of like sidecar. I just put out a blog post on sidecar, which is a term that we use very frequently in the community, but it's just kind of a colloquial term, honestly. It doesn't have a specific meaning in the technology. It's just how we describe the pattern. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Correct. KASLIN FIELDS: And service mesh is kind of similar. It's the pattern, I guess, of extending Kubernetes in-- ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Correct. KASLIN FIELDS: --really in a broad definition of ways. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, I think really you can think about service mesh as-- again, whether it's based on sidecars or not based on sidecars-- because Cilium is not. It's eBPF-based, so there is technically no sidecars. But you can think about it as-- one way is to take the term \"service mesh\" and look at the \"mesh.\" What does a \"mesh\" mean? It just literally means that all your pods inside the cluster-- and potentially in various clusters, so multicluster is set up-- know about each other. And they can route traffic between them all the time because in a nonservice mesh scenario, we just use services of type load balancer, so the cluster IP, and then you have that virtual IP that you send requests to. And then it gets translated to a pod IPs. In the service mesh world, the pods know where all the other pods are, so that's one way of thinking about it. And then the second way is Kubernetes networking is pretty dumb. It's pretty basic. It's IP-based, so it's IP port. Service mesh adds those functionalities about observability, about more fine-grained network controls based on identities instead of just a basic firewall and stuff like that. So yeah, again, I think we probably need to do a whole episode just talking about service mesh. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah, there have been several on the podcast before, but we should probably update some of that because it's been a while. I'd say that service mesh is not as big of a hot topic as it used to be, but it's definitely still around. And people are definitely still using it a lot. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, we should do some service mesh in 2024. KASLIN FIELDS: That would be interesting, yeah. I have some ideas for that. We'll talk about that later. But-- ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, sure. KASLIN FIELDS: --a couple more things quickly here. One thing that I thought was cool was that Cilium essentially works by using DaemonSets in Kubernetes. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, for the agent. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah, it's, I think-- I kind of hesitate to use this term, but kind of a best practice in Kubernetes. A lot of the time, folks want to run things on the nodes in Kubernetes, and they run them directly on the node to have root access to the node so that they can run-- especially the kinds of things that Cilium does, the kind of observability and the kind of system-level observability into your applications. And they'll run that directly on the node, which I tend to see as an anti-pattern because you don't want to be messing around with the nodes of the Kubernetes cluster. As much as you can you want to be staying within Kubernetes. So I think it's really cool that Cilium is eBPF, so it's really at the Kernel level, but it's still staying within the abstraction of Kubernetes as well. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, yeah, that's very interesting. I had to go after the interview and do some snooping around the documentation to understand the architecture and stuff, but yeah, that's a very valid observation. It's interesting that they do the agent-- it's not only the agent for Cilium itself. It's even the agent for Hubble, which is the observability stack of Cilium. That also runs as a DaemonSet. I have tried this on GKE before. It works, actually. It's pretty cool. It gives you this like nice interface, and it tells you what's talking to what and the amount of traffic and all those things. KASLIN FIELDS: I don't know if it works on GKE Autopilot. I know at the beginning of GKE Autopilot-- ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Ah, that's a valid point. KASLIN FIELDS: --did not fully work because Autopilot puts in several security barriers and forces you into best practices. And one of those best practices that autopilot tries to force you into is keeping things at the Kubernetes abstraction layer, and so there are some things that are closer to the operating system, things that would require root access or access to your nodes that could be dangerous that autopilot doesn't allow you to do. And eBPF is one of those things that kind of skirts that line. Bill talked a little bit about some of the security features of eBPF to protect your Kernel, but one of the biggest complaints that I hear-- reasons not to use eBPF that I hear is concerns about security because anything that you're doing that's going to run things at the Kernel level is, of course, going to be a little bit scary security-wise. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, of course. Yeah, so I tried Hubble on Dataplane Version 2, which is Cilium-based, but on Standard mode, not Autopilot mode. So I don't know if it works on Autopilot mode. I would assume not because I think the way Autopilot works is that we have special partnerships with companies that have tools that-- they call them security partners or something. Certain things work that require privileged containers, but we have to explicitly allow them to work. It's kind of the opposite of how standard mode works. I don't know about Cilium. I think we'll have to do some digging to figure that out. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah, that's always kind of the tradeoff is, how much abstraction do you want versus how much control do you want? ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, correct. KASLIN FIELDS: Autopilot is one of those abstraction layers that takes away a bit more of that control, but it makes things a little bit easier to do and to do right, theoretically. So they try to put in some good guidelines, but Cilium will be one of those interesting cases that's like-- we'll have to look into it. Last thing-- the beginning of the interview, what I learned about eBPF from this interview-- I think the way that I would likely describe it to folks is it's a good way to be able to run things at the Kernel level without having to get them into open source. I thought that was a really cool use case that Bill described, and so I feel like that's kind of the core of what it allows you to accomplish. What do you think, Abdel? ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Yeah, I think that's a very good way of putting it. I remember that part from the conversation. Yeah, if you want to extend Linux functionalities, it will take you ages to get that accepted by the community and contributed upstream, and eBPF allows you to do that relatively quickly. So that's a very good way of describing it. KASLIN FIELDS: I wonder if Linux maintainers have seen any impact on their workload from the introduction of eBPF. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: I guess to a large extent we can draw a lot of analogies between how Kubernetes work and how Linux Kernel work in the sense that Kubernetes and Linux are trying to keep things under control, and they don't want to just like start accepting any sort of customization required. So what they're doing is that they're just building an abstraction layer. They say, as long as your thing talks this API, we don't care. And I think Linux works a little bit like that in the sense that here is eBPF. You can extend it by yourself and write code inside this thing. It's your problem. We're just going to give you the API, and that's it. KASLIN FIELDS: Yep. There have been a lot of parallels drawn between Kubernetes itself and the Linux Kernel itself over time. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: It's the two biggest projects, open source projects, right? KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Two very successful open source projects, so. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah, so enormous. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Exactly. KASLIN FIELDS: Anyway, thank you very much, Abdel. ABDEL SGHIOUAR: Thank you. KASLIN FIELDS: Yeah. We'll see you all next time. That brings us to the end of another episode.

Register Now I know this isn’t fun to imagine, but hear me out: when your services go down, whether on-premises or in the cloud, you need to be ready to respond quickly. This feels obvious. And with major traffic spikes during big holiday seasons, this support burden becomes huge on today's reliability teams, who could really use some extra support, themselves. Enter Duet AI! AI-augmented reliability engineering Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) need up-to-date, easy-to-digest insight into how the services and apps are performing, so they can (ideally) catch issues before they cause outages. When errors or alerts start popping up, Duet AI, an assistive AI tool,can help you make sense of the messages and also speed up your investigation. Let me show you how… When strange issues show up, often in emails, alerts, or paging systems, Duet AI is ready to help you interpret them. Incidents, errors, or just higher than normal failure rates all can be summarized by the AI assistant inside Google Cloud. And when you start digging into logs, Duet AI is ready to help you with queries, explanations and documentation guidance. Saving valuable time, and getting you to the fix faster. I don't know about you, but I find it challenging to keep all the Prometheus Query Language syntax in my head when I need it, so I'm SO grateful for the help from Duet AI. I can use natural language to talk through what I want and need, and it’s usually faster than having to consult the logs schema or error codes. Now you can do your rubber-ducking with a real duck or a virtual one! Duet never gets tired of listening to me, and helping me talk through (and solve) various technical problems. Mitigation and quick fixes Once you do have the root cause identified, you can also use Duet AI to help you with fixes, through step-by-step instructions, pointers to relevant documentation, or advice. And while it can do a lot, it can't do the fun stuff, like help you play the clarinet. So I’ll just have to do that myself. Speaking of which, I should get to practicing. But enough about my hobbies; try out all the Duet AI goodness with this learning path on Duet AI for DevOps, so you can get started today.

Contributing \\n This document provides guidelines for contributing to samples. \\n Before you begin \\n Sign our Contributor License Agreement \\n Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a\\n Contributor License Agreement (CLA).\\nYou (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply\\ngives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the\\nproject. \\n If you or your current employer have already signed the Google CLA (even if it\\nwas for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again. \\n Visit https://cla.developers.google.com/ to see your current agreements or to\\nsign a new one. \\n Review our Community Guidelines \\n This project follows\\n Google's Open Source Community Guidelines . \\n Review Terraform sample requirements, best practices, and code style \\n If you are submitting or reviewing a pull request, make sure that the sample\\nfollows the rules for quality and consistency. \\n Code style \\n For samples that you add to the terraform-docs-samples GitHub repository,\\nmake sure that they follow the style guidelines for Terraform described in the\\n Effective samples style guide . \\n Other requirements and best practices \\n \\n \\n (Required) Samples maintained in terraform-docs-samples must include only\\n resource and data blocks. Don't include module blocks in your samples. \\n Note: If you want to use a sample that contains module \\nblocks, you can use the Cloud Foundation Toolkit\\nmodules . \\n \\n \\n (Required) Don't create a README file for your sample. \\n \\n \\n (Recommended) If a sample needs an API enabled, add the service to the\\n Test setup file . \\n \\n \\n (Recommened) If a sample adds a new directory, add code owners to the CODEOWNERS\\nfile . \\n \\n \\n (Recommended) In each resource that has a name argument, include the name \\nargument first in the resource block. \\n \\n \\n (Recommended) For maintainability, don't include other-vendor resources.\\nMulti-cloud isn't recommended in terraform-docs-samples . Only Google\\nprovider resources are  recommended. For example, terraform-docs-samples \\nsamples shouldn't have Azure or AWS resources. For multi-cloud samples,\\n create a blueprint instead. \\n \\n \\n (Recommended) For simplicity and consistency, use default as the Terraform\\nresource name when possible. The only time it isn't possible is if a single\\nsample has multiple resources of the same type. They can't all have the same\\nresource name. In this case, use what makes sense for your sample. \\n \\n \\n (Recommended) If your sample enables an API, add\\n disable_on_destroy = false to prevent the API from being disabled when\\ndeleting the resources. \\n \\n \\n Dependencies for testing \\n The following dependencies must be installed on the development system: \\n \\n Docker Engine \\n Google Cloud SDK \\n make \\n \\n Cloud Shell is recommended for development because these tools are pre-installed. \\n Linting and Formatting \\n Files in the repository are linted or formatted to maintain a standard of quality and statically validated.\\nYou can run this check locally: \\n cd terraform-docs-samples\\n \\n make docker_test_lint\\n \\n Integration Testing \\n Integration tests are used to verify that the samples are actuatable\\nby Terraform. Tests are dynamically discovered based on directories in\\nrepo root and executed using the blueprint-test framework. \\n Set up the Test Environment \\n The easiest way to test the samples are in isolated test projects. The\\nsetup for projects are defined in test/setup \\ndirectory. \\n To use this setup, you need to authenticate gcloud with an identity that has\\nProject Creator access on a folder and the Billing Account User role on a billing account. \\n \\n \\n Get you project's organization ID and folder ID: \\n gcloud projects get-ancestors <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>\\n \\n \\n \\n Get your project's billing ID by opening https://console.cloud.google.com/billing . \\n \\n \\n Set the following environment variables. \\n export TF_VAR_org_id=\\\"your_org_id\\\"\\n \\n export TF_VAR_folder_id=\\\"your_folder_id\\\"\\n \\n export TF_VAR_billing_account=\\\"your_billing_account_id\\\"\\n \\n \\n \\n Ensure that you are locally authenticated using gcloud: \\n gcloud auth application-default login\\n \\n \\n \\n With these settings in place, you can prepare a test project using Docker: \\n cd terraform-docs-samples\\n \\n make docker_test_prepare\\n \\n \\n \\n Sample Output: \\n Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.\\n\\nOutputs:\\n\\nproject_ids = [\\n  \\\"ci-tf-samples-0-c5ab\\\",\\n  \\\"ci-tf-samples-1-f344\\\",\\n  \\\"ci-tf-samples-2-b5a7\\\",\\n  \\\"ci-tf-samples-3-6eda\\\",\\n]\\n...\\n \\n Noninteractive Execution \\n Run make -s docker_test_sample SAMPLE=${SAMPLE_NAME} to test a sample\\nnoninteractively. This will initialize, apply, verify and destroy the\\nspecified sample. \\n SAMPLE_NAME is the name of the lowest most containing folder. For example, to test the sample in /storage/new_bucket/main.tf , use SAMPLE=new_bucket .

BigQuery and Remote Functions can be used to analyze images and text input using the Vertex AI Gemini API on Google Cloud. The following instructions should help you get started. \\n Calling Gemini using SQL \\n This repo allows you to pass requests to Gemini using SQL and get the results back like you would for any other BigQuery query. This approach has several advantages: \\n \\n It allows users who are familiar with SQL to leverage the power of Gemini without needing to write additional code \\n You can more easily analyze a large batch of data rather than having to make individual requests for each image or text prompt \\n You don't need to export your data from BigQuery before you can analyze it with Gemini \\n \\n About this demo \\n We've created a Terraform module that deploys all the necessary resources to call the Vertex AI Gemini API using SQL in BigQuery. \\n After the module is deployed, you will have access to two BigQuery Remote Functions : \\n \\n Analyze images and text (multimodal input) using gemini_bq_demo_image : This remote function takes an image from GCS as an input and prompts the Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model to create a brief description of the image \\n Analyze text using gemini_bq_demo_text : This remote function takes text in a BigQuery table and uses the text directly as prompts for the Gemini 1.0 Pro model to return a response \\n \\n You will also have access to two BigQuery stored procedures which allow you to easy test each remote function using real image and text data: \\n \\n image_query_remote_function_sp : This SQL query uses the gemini_bq_demo_image remote function to send a list of image URIs stored in an object table (deployed as part of the module) along with a prompt to Gemini \\n text_query_remote_function_sp : This SQL query uses the gemini_bq_demo_text remote function to send a sample BigQuery table with pre-written text prompts (deployed as part of the module) to Gemini \\n \\n Getting Started \\n Deploying the infrastructure \\n Note: Though using a new GCP project for this example is not a requirement, it might be easiest to use a new GCP project for this. This makes cleanup much easier, as you can delete the whole project to ensure all assets are removed and it ensures no potential conflicts with existing resources. You can also remove resources by running terraform destroy after you deploy the resources, but it will also disable the associated APIs. \\n 1. Clone this repo in Cloud Shell \\n You'll need to set your Google Cloud project in Cloud Shell, clone this repo locally first, and set the working directory to this folder using the following commands. \\n gcloud config set project < PROJECT ID > \\ngit clone  https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/\\n cd ./generative-ai/gemini/use-cases/applying-llms-to-data/using-gemini-with-bigquery-remote-functions \\n 2. Enable the Cloud Resource Manager API \\n Check to make sure the Cloud Resource Manager API is enabled \\n 3. Intialize Terraform \\n First, initialize Terraform by running \\n terraform init \\n 4. Review resources \\n Review the resources that are defined in the configuration: \\n terraform plan \\n 5. Deploy the Terraform script \\n terraform apply \\n When you're prompted to perform the actions, enter yes . Terraform will prompt you to provide your project ID and region. This sample has been tested using region us-central1 . Terraform will display messages showing the progress of the deployment. \\n After all the resources are created, Terraform displays the following message: \\n Apply complete ! \\n The Terraform output also lists the following additional information that you'll need: \\n \\n The link to open the BigQuery editor to invoke the image_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure that analyzes the sample images provided \\n The link to open the BigQuery editor to invoke the text_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure that analyzes the sample text prompts provided \\n \\n If you need to see your Terraform outputs again, simply enter terraform output into your command line. \\n Analyzing sample data with your new deployment \\n Now that the resources have been deployed, your BigQuery Remote Functions are ready to be used in SQL queries. \\n 1. Analyze text and images (multimodal) \\n Gemini will analyze the sample images when you invoke the image_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure. Simply click Invoke stored procedure for the stored procedure, then click Run for the resulting query to get the image descriptions generated by Gemini through your Remote Function. \\n \\n \\n \\n 2. Analyze text only \\n Gemini will analyze the prewritten text prompts when you invoke the text_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure. Simply click Invoke stored procedure , then click Run in the resulting query to get the responses generated by Gemini through your Remote Function. \\n \\n \\n \\n How it works \\n Architecture Diagrams \\n Image analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Sample images are uploaded to a Cloud Storage bucket and a GCS object table is created in BigQuery \\n Cloud Workflows creates a stored procedure in BigQuery that contains the sample query, which references the object table created in step 1 to pass images to the remote function for analysis using the Vertex AI Gemini API \\n The stored procedure from step 2 is used to invoke the Cloud Function through a BigQuery connection \\n The Cloud Function analyzes the sample images by passing them to the Vertex AI Gemini API (step 5) to get a brief description of the sample images and returns results from the Vertex AI Gemini API as query results \\n \\n Text analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Cloud Workflows creates a stored procedure in BigQuery that contains the sample query and provisions the sample_text_prompts table, which contains sample text prompts to describe various landmarks. The sample query passes these prompts to the remote function for analysis using the Vertex AI Gemini API \\n The stored procedure from step 2 is used to invoke the Cloud Function through a BigQuery connection \\n The Cloud Function analyzes the text input from the sample text by passing them to the Vertex AI Gemini API (step 4) to get generate a text response to each prompt and returns results from the Vertex AI Gemini API as query results \\n \\n Pricing Estimation \\n Installing this demo (by running terraform apply in the Cloud Shell CLI) and running the stored stored procedures for text and image analysis 4 times each day will cost approximately $0.06 USD per month. See the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator for more details. The total monthly cost will vary as your usage varies, including how often you deploy and teardown this demo. \\n NOTE : Charges for Multimodal model consumption in Vertex AI take effect on January 15, 2024. We estimate running this demo 4 times per day will increase the total cost by $3.73 USD per month . See the Vertex AI pricing page for Generative AI for full details. Below is a breakdown of this estimate: \\n \\n \\n Text analysis \\n \\n $0.02/month for Text Input \\n $0.23/month for Text Output \\n \\n \\n \\n Image analysis \\n \\n $3.30/month for Image Input \\n $0.18/month for Text Output \\n \\n \\n \\n Keep in mind that generative AI models like Gemini are non-deterministic, so associated costs will vary based on the output length and cannot be definitively estimated. \\n Make it your own \\n You can adapt this demo for your own use case! Check out the instructions below for image and text analysis. \\n Analyze images \\n You can get started analyzing any images you have uploaded to Cloud Storage by: \\n \\n \\n Create a Cloud Storage object table \\n If your bucket is stored in the same region that you deployed this demo, you should be able to reuse the existing BigQuery connection. If not, you will likely have to create a new one. \\n \\n \\n Modify the context variable on line 40 of the Cloud Function \\n You can do this by editing the gemini-bq-demo-image that was deployed. Click the Edit button at the top of the Function Details page, then click Next to see the in-line editor. Change the value of the context variable to provide tell Gemini what it should do with your images, then click Deploy. \\n Check out this sample notebook for inspiration and ideas of what you can ask Gemini to do with an image. \\n \\n \\n Update the image_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure and run \\n Update line 5 of the stored procedure to reference the object table you created in step 1 and run the query. \\n \\n \\n Analyze text \\n You can get started by analyzing your own text inputs without having to modify the existing Cloud Function. Simply replace the text_prompt in line 3 of the text_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure with whatever text you want to analyze. You can enter a single string of text or you can reference a column of text prompts from a BigQuery table. If you are using a column from a BigQuery table, be sure to update the table reference on line 5 of the stored procedure. \\n Clean up \\n After you are finished with the demo, you can delete all the resources you created with the following steps: \\n \\n \\n Update the variables.tf file \\n Change the default value for the force_destroy variable from false to true . Change the default value for the deletion_protection variable from false to true . \\n \\n \\n Run terraform apply \\n This applies the changes you made in step 1 to your resources so they can be easily deleted. \\n \\n \\n Delete the BigQuery dataset \\n Run the following command in your CLI to delete the BigQuery dataset created: \\n bq rm -r -f -d gemini_demo \\n \\n \\n Run terraform destroy \\n This deletes all the remaining resources you created. \\n \\n \\n \",\"errorMessage\":null,\"headerInfo\":{\"toc\":[{\"level\":1,\"text\":\"Analyzing images and text with Gemini using BigQuery & Remote Functions\",\"anchor\":\"analyzing-images-and-text-with-gemini-using-bigquery--remote-functions\",\"htmlText\":\"Analyzing images and text with Gemini using BigQuery & Remote Functions\"},{\"level\":2,\"text\":\"Overview\",\"anchor\":\"overview\",\"htmlText\":\"Overview\"},{\"level\":2,\"text\":\"Calling Gemini using SQL\",\"anchor\":\"calling-gemini-using-sql\",\"htmlText\":\"Calling Gemini using SQL\"},{\"level\":2,\"text\":\"About this demo\",\"anchor\":\"about-this-demo\",\"htmlText\":\"About this demo\"},{\"level\":2,\"text\":\"Getting Started\",\"anchor\":\"getting-started\",\"htmlText\":\"Getting Started\"},{\"level\":3,\"text\":\"Deploying the infrastructure\",\"anchor\":\"deploying-the-infrastructure\",\"htmlText\":\"Deploying the infrastructure\"},{\"level\":4,\"text\":\"1.

Register Modern applications demand developers to build APIs that handle intricate features, deliver lightning-fast performance, and materialize in record time. As platform engineers, you are the unsung heroes that empower developers with the right tools and practices to make API development a less of a burden. As a platform engineer, how can you influence API development? Turns out there are five high-level strategies to follow. As a platform engineer you can help your developers create better APIs by: Treating APIs and internal platforms as products Embedding API management into your internal platform Building CI/CD pipelines for your proxies and policies Creating golden paths for developer consumption Leveraging Apigee for management and automation of APIs Let’s take a look at each of these strategies. 1. Treating APIs and internal platforms as products A great digital connected experience is powered by APIs, digital mechanisms that enable applications to talk to each other. Simply put, APIs are just software products that power service integration. Just as any other software product that is shipped to a consumer, APIs should be tested, secured, deployed and managed using a systematic process like the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Internal platforms enable delivery of these digital products. They do this by delivering a common set of tools and opinionated templating for the developers to use. For example, maybe your organization has a requirement that specifies that all applications that want to access APIs must present an OAuth token. The platform engineer would create a golden path that makes available a shared flow pipeline that would be used to attach an OAuth v2 policy to the proxy using a flow callout . Just as APIs are products, so are internal platforms. Breaking down internal silos to work across teams in your organization to understand requirements is a primary function of any platform engineering team. This collaboration results in better tooling for the developer. 2. Embedding API management into your platform At the core, you are responsible for creating internal platforms for developers to use. These platforms enable developer autonomy, by providing developers with access to opinionated templates and tooling. Creating these templates and tools allow various aspects of API management to be handled by your platform. Embedding API management into your platform allows things like standardization, security, quotas, and monitoring, and automated deployment to be baked into your platform. 3. Building CI/CD pipelines for your proxies and policies Because APIs are digital products, they should be created and managed through code. A common task for platform engineers is to create CI/CD pipelines, to automate the software-development life cycle of APIs. A standard CI/CD pipeline consists of static code analysis, unit testing, deployment and integration testing. At a high level, a developer locally develops a proxy and uses Git to commit the proxy code to a source code repository. A commit kicks off an automated pipeline that performs testing and provides feedback. If successful, the code is promoted to various environments until it is released to production. After building your APIs, you want them to be discoverable by others in your organization. API Hub is great for internal API discovery. You can utilize the developer portal for external API discovery and documentation for your customers. 4. Creating golden paths for developer consumption Golden paths consist of templates that integrate code and tooling to increase developer velocity. As the name suggests, a golden path helps a developer find the path of least resistance when building software, often by leveraging self-service templates and workflows. These templates consist of common tasks and opinionated strategies. When developing APIs with Apigee, a standard golden path might include: A getting started guide Scaffold template for proxy / policy creation / mock backend Standard Shared flow configs which are automatically injected CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment API registry templates 5. Leveraging Apigee for management and automation of APIs Let’s talk about the star of the show: Apigee , an API management platform that provides platform teams with tools to build, manage, and secure APIs. Apigee can be used to manage your APIs throughout their lifecycle. APIs in Apigee start with a proxy , a digital interface that sits between your customer and your business logic (or backend). The proxy also serves as an attachment point for API policies , allowing your organization to program API behavior. Proxies also allow you to decouple your API from directly accessing your backend and hide complexity. As a platform engineer you help developers create better APIs by enabling them to focus on proxy creation. Your platform should be opinionated on how your APIs should function. Apigee tools like Shared Flows allow you to enforce standardization and consistency. FlowCallout policies and flow hooks allow these policies to be attached to proxies and reused across APIs. Build better APIs By treating APIs and internal platforms as products, embedding API management into your platform, leveraging Apigee for management and automation of APIs, building CI/CD pipelines for your proxies and policies, and creating golden paths for developer consumption, you can help your developers build better APIs with Apigee.

Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account. Understanding Regions and Zones Certain Compute Engine resources live in regions or zones. A region is a specific geographical location where you can run your resources. Each region has one or more zones. For example, the us-central1 region denotes a region in the Central United States that has zones us-central1-a , us-central1-b , us-central1-c , and us-central1-f . Regions Zones Western US us-west1-a, us-west1-b Central US us-central1-a, us-central1-b, us-central1-d, us-central1-f Eastern US us-east1-b, us-east1-c, us-east1-d Western Europe europe-west1-b, europe-west1-c, europe-west1-d Eastern Asia asia-east1-a, asia-east1-b, asia-east1-c Resources that live in a zone are referred to as zonal resources. Virtual machine Instances and persistent disks live in a zone. To attach a persistent disk to a virtual machine instance, both resources must be in the same zone. Similarly, if you want to assign a static IP address to an instance, the instance must be in the same region as the static IP.

BigQuery and Remote Functions can be used to analyze images and text input using the Vertex AI Gemini API on Google Cloud. The following instructions should help you get started. \\n Calling Gemini using SQL \\n This repo allows you to pass requests to Gemini using SQL and get the results back like you would for any other BigQuery query. This approach has several advantages: \\n \\n It allows users who are familiar with SQL to leverage the power of Gemini without needing to write additional code \\n You can more easily analyze a large batch of data rather than having to make individual requests for each image or text prompt \\n You don't need to export your data from BigQuery before you can analyze it with Gemini \\n \\n About this demo \\n We've created a Terraform module that deploys all the necessary resources to call the Vertex AI Gemini API using SQL in BigQuery. \\n After the module is deployed, you will have access to two BigQuery Remote Functions : \\n \\n Analyze images and text (multimodal input) using gemini_bq_demo_image : This remote function takes an image from GCS as an input and prompts the Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model to create a brief description of the image \\n Analyze text using gemini_bq_demo_text : This remote function takes text in a BigQuery table and uses the text directly as prompts for the Gemini 1.0 Pro model to return a response \\n \\n You will also have access to two BigQuery stored procedures which allow you to easy test each remote function using real image and text data: \\n \\n image_query_remote_function_sp : This SQL query uses the gemini_bq_demo_image remote function to send a list of image URIs stored in an object table (deployed as part of the module) along with a prompt to Gemini \\n text_query_remote_function_sp : This SQL query uses the gemini_bq_demo_text remote function to send a sample BigQuery table with pre-written text prompts (deployed as part of the module) to Gemini \\n \\n Getting Started \\n Deploying the infrastructure \\n Note: Though using a new GCP project for this example is not a requirement, it might be easiest to use a new GCP project for this. This makes cleanup much easier, as you can delete the whole project to ensure all assets are removed and it ensures no potential conflicts with existing resources. You can also remove resources by running terraform destroy after you deploy the resources, but it will also disable the associated APIs. \\n 1. Clone this repo in Cloud Shell \\n You'll need to set your Google Cloud project in Cloud Shell, clone this repo locally first, and set the working directory to this folder using the following commands. \\n gcloud config set project < PROJECT ID > \\ngit clone  https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/\\n cd ./generative-ai/gemini/use-cases/applying-llms-to-data/using-gemini-with-bigquery-remote-functions \\n 2. Enable the Cloud Resource Manager API \\n Check to make sure the Cloud Resource Manager API is enabled \\n 3. Intialize Terraform \\n First, initialize Terraform by running \\n terraform init \\n 4. Review resources \\n Review the resources that are defined in the configuration: \\n terraform plan \\n 5. Deploy the Terraform script \\n terraform apply \\n When you're prompted to perform the actions, enter yes . Terraform will prompt you to provide your project ID and region. This sample has been tested using region us-central1 . Terraform will display messages showing the progress of the deployment. \\n After all the resources are created, Terraform displays the following message: \\n Apply complete ! \\n The Terraform output also lists the following additional information that you'll need: \\n \\n The link to open the BigQuery editor to invoke the image_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure that analyzes the sample images provided \\n The link to open the BigQuery editor to invoke the text_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure that analyzes the sample text prompts provided \\n \\n If you need to see your Terraform outputs again, simply enter terraform output into your command line. \\n Analyzing sample data with your new deployment \\n Now that the resources have been deployed, your BigQuery Remote Functions are ready to be used in SQL queries. \\n 1. Analyze text and images (multimodal) \\n Gemini will analyze the sample images when you invoke the image_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure. Simply click Invoke stored procedure for the stored procedure, then click Run for the resulting query to get the image descriptions generated by Gemini through your Remote Function. \\n \\n \\n \\n 2. Analyze text only \\n Gemini will analyze the prewritten text prompts when you invoke the text_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure. Simply click Invoke stored procedure , then click Run in the resulting query to get the responses generated by Gemini through your Remote Function. \\n \\n \\n \\n How it works \\n Architecture Diagrams \\n Image analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Sample images are uploaded to a Cloud Storage bucket and a GCS object table is created in BigQuery \\n Cloud Workflows creates a stored procedure in BigQuery that contains the sample query, which references the object table created in step 1 to pass images to the remote function for analysis using the Vertex AI Gemini API \\n The stored procedure from step 2 is used to invoke the Cloud Function through a BigQuery connection \\n The Cloud Function analyzes the sample images by passing them to the Vertex AI Gemini API (step 5) to get a brief description of the sample images and returns results from the Vertex AI Gemini API as query results \\n \\n Text analysis \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Cloud Workflows creates a stored procedure in BigQuery that contains the sample query and provisions the sample_text_prompts table, which contains sample text prompts to describe various landmarks. The sample query passes these prompts to the remote function for analysis using the Vertex AI Gemini API \\n The stored procedure from step 2 is used to invoke the Cloud Function through a BigQuery connection \\n The Cloud Function analyzes the text input from the sample text by passing them to the Vertex AI Gemini API (step 4) to get generate a text response to each prompt and returns results from the Vertex AI Gemini API as query results \\n \\n Pricing Estimation \\n Installing this demo (by running terraform apply in the Cloud Shell CLI) and running the stored stored procedures for text and image analysis 4 times each day will cost approximately $0.06 USD per month. See the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator for more details. The total monthly cost will vary as your usage varies, including how often you deploy and teardown this demo. \\n NOTE : Charges for Multimodal model consumption in Vertex AI take effect on January 15, 2024. We estimate running this demo 4 times per day will increase the total cost by $3.73 USD per month . See the Vertex AI pricing page for Generative AI for full details. Below is a breakdown of this estimate: \\n \\n \\n Text analysis \\n \\n $0.02/month for Text Input \\n $0.23/month for Text Output \\n \\n \\n \\n Image analysis \\n \\n $3.30/month for Image Input \\n $0.18/month for Text Output \\n \\n \\n \\n Keep in mind that generative AI models like Gemini are non-deterministic, so associated costs will vary based on the output length and cannot be definitively estimated. \\n Make it your own \\n You can adapt this demo for your own use case! Check out the instructions below for image and text analysis. \\n Analyze images \\n You can get started analyzing any images you have uploaded to Cloud Storage by: \\n \\n \\n Create a Cloud Storage object table \\n If your bucket is stored in the same region that you deployed this demo, you should be able to reuse the existing BigQuery connection. If not, you will likely have to create a new one. \\n \\n \\n Modify the context variable on line 40 of the Cloud Function \\n You can do this by editing the gemini-bq-demo-image that was deployed. Click the Edit button at the top of the Function Details page, then click Next to see the in-line editor. Change the value of the context variable to provide tell Gemini what it should do with your images, then click Deploy. \\n Check out this sample notebook for inspiration and ideas of what you can ask Gemini to do with an image. \\n \\n \\n Update the image_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure and run \\n Update line 5 of the stored procedure to reference the object table you created in step 1 and run the query. \\n \\n \\n Analyze text \\n You can get started by analyzing your own text inputs without having to modify the existing Cloud Function. Simply replace the text_prompt in line 3 of the text_query_remote_function_sp stored procedure with whatever text you want to analyze. You can enter a single string of text or you can reference a column of text prompts from a BigQuery table. If you are using a column from a BigQuery table, be sure to update the table reference on line 5 of the stored procedure. \\n Clean up \\n After you are finished with the demo, you can delete all the resources you created with the following steps: \\n \\n \\n Update the variables.tf file \\n Change the default value for the force_destroy variable from false to true . Change the default value for the deletion_protection variable from false to true . \\n \\n \\n Run terraform apply \\n This applies the changes you made in step 1 to your resources so they can be easily deleted. \\n \\n \\n Delete the BigQuery dataset \\n Run the following command in your CLI to delete the BigQuery dataset created: \\n bq rm -r -f -d gemini_demo \\n \\n \\n Run terraform destroy \\n This deletes all the remaining resources you created. \\n \\n \\n \",\"errorMessage\":null,\"headerInfo\":{\"toc\":[{\"level\":1,\"text\":\"Analyzing images and text with Gemini using BigQuery & Remote Functions\",\"anchor\":\"analyzing-images-and-text-with-gemini-using-bigquery--remote-functions\",\"htmlText\":\"Analyzing images and text with Gemini using BigQuery & Remote Functions\"},{\"level\":2,\"text\":\"Overview\",\"anchor\":\"overview\",\"htmlText\":\"Overview\"},{\"level\":2,\"text\":\"Calling Gemini using SQL\",\"anchor\":\"calling-gemini-using-sql\",\"htmlText\":\"Calling Gemini using SQL\"},{\"level\":2,\"text\":\"About this demo\",\"anchor\":\"about-this-demo\",\"htmlText\":\"About this demo\"},{\"level\":2,\"text\":\"Getting Started\",\"anchor\":\"getting-started\",\"htmlText\":\"Getting Started\"},{\"level\":3,\"text\":\"Deploying the infrastructure\",\"anchor\":\"deploying-the-infrastructure\",\"htmlText\":\"Deploying the infrastructure\"},{\"level\":4,\"text\":\"1.

            "Contents: Fear and Loathing in Security Dashboards | Postmodern Security Postmodern Security An End to Manifestos Other Writing About Mrs. Y. Welcome To My Lair videos Resources Blog Posts Jan 25 2024 1 Comment By Michele Chubirka aka \"Mrs. Y\" Blog Posts Fear and Loathing in Security Dashboards Recently a colleague asked for my help in understanding why he was seeing a specific security alert on a dashboard. The message said that his database instance was “exposed to a broad public IP range.” He disagreed with this assessment because it misrepresented the configuration context. While the database had a public IP, only one port was available, and it was behind a proxy. The access to this test instance was also restricted to “authorized” IP address ranges. I explained that this kind of information is what security practitioners like to know as they evaluate risk, but then thought, “is this a reasonable alert for a user or just more noise?” When did security dashboards become like the news, more information than we can reasonably take in, overloading our cognitive faculties and creating stress ? I have a complicated relationship with security dashboards. Though I understand different teams need a quick view of what they need to prioritize, findings are broadly categorized as high, medium, and low without much background. This approach can create confusion and disagreements between groups because those categories are generally aligned to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals .  Green is good, red is bad, and yellow means caution. The problem is that a lot of findings end up red and yellow, with categorization dependent upon how well the security team has tuned alerts and your organizational risk tolerance. Most nuance is lost. The other problem is that this data categorization isn’t only seen as a prioritization technique. It can communicate danger. As humans, we have learned to associate red on a dashboard with some level of threat . This might be why some people develop fanariphobia, a fear of traffic lights . Is this an intentional design choice? Historically, Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), which explains how humans are motivated to protect themselves when threatened, has been used as a standard technique within the domain of cybersecurity to justify the use of fear appeals. But what if this doesn’t work as well as we think it does? A recent academic paper reviewed literature in this space and found conflicting data on the value of fear appeals in promoting voluntary security behaviors. It often backfires, leading to a reduction in desired responses. What does work? The researchers identify Stewardship Theory as a more efficacious approach leading to improved security behaviors by employees. They define it as “a covenantal relationship between the individual and the organization” which “connects both employee and employer to work toward a common goal, characterized by moral commitment between employees and the organization.” Am I suggesting you should throw your security dashboards away? No, but I think we can agree that they’re a limited view, which can exacerbate conflict between teams. Instead of being the end of a conversation, they should be the beginning, a dialog tool that encourages a collaborative discussion between teams about risk.

Introduction In this codelab you will learn how to deploy the GenAI Databases Retrieval Service and create a sample interactive application using the deployed environment. You can get more information about the GenAI Retrieval Service and the sample application here . Prerequisites A basic  understanding of the Google Cloud Console Basic skills in command line interface and Google Cloud shell What you'll learn How to deploy AlloyDB Cluster How to connect to the AlloyDB How to configure and deploy GenAI Databases Retrieval Service How to deploy a sample application using the deployed service What you'll need A Google Cloud Account and Google Cloud Project A web browser such as Chrome 2. Setup and Requirements Self-paced environment setup Sign-in to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project or reuse an existing one. If you don't already have a Gmail or Google Workspace account, you must create one . The Project name is the display name for this project's participants. It is a character string not used by Google APIs. You can always update it. The Project ID is unique across all Google Cloud projects and is immutable (cannot be changed after it has been set). The Cloud Console auto-generates a unique string; usually you don't care what it is. In most codelabs, you'll need to reference your Project ID (typically identified as PROJECT_ID ). If you don't like the generated ID, you might generate another random one. Alternatively, you can try your own, and see if it's available. It can't be changed after this step and remains for the duration of the project. For your information, there is a third value, a Project Number , which some APIs use. Learn more about all three of these values in the documentation . Caution: A project ID is globally unique and can't be used by anyone else after you've selected it. You are the only user of that ID. Even if a project is deleted, the ID can't be used again Note: If you use a Gmail account, you can leave the default location set to No organization . If you use a Google Workspace account, choose a location that makes sense for your organization. Next, you'll need to enable billing in the Cloud Console to use Cloud resources/APIs. Running through this codelab won't cost much, if anything at all. To shut down resources to avoid incurring billing beyond this tutorial, you can delete the resources you created or delete the project. New Google Cloud users are eligible for the $300 USD Free Trial program. Start Cloud Shell While Google Cloud can be operated remotely from your laptop, in this codelab you will be using Google Cloud Shell , a command line environment running in the Cloud. From the Google Cloud Console , click the Cloud Shell icon on the top right toolbar: It should only take a few moments to provision and connect to the environment. When it is finished, you should see something like this: This virtual machine is loaded with all the development tools you'll need. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory, and runs on Google Cloud, greatly enhancing network performance and authentication. All of your work in this codelab can be done within a browser. You do not need to install anything. 3. Before you begin Enable API Output: Please be aware that some resources you enable are going to incur some cost if you are not using the promotional tier. In normal circumstances if all the resources are destroyed upon completion of the lab the cost of all resources would not exceed $5. We recommend checking your billing and making sure the exercise is acceptable for you. Inside Cloud Shell, make sure that your project ID is setup: Usually the project ID is shown in parentheses in the command prompt in the cloud shell as it is shown in the picture: gcloud config set project [YOUR-PROJECT-ID] Then set the PROJECT_ID environment variable to your Google Cloud project ID: PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project) Enable all necessary services: gcloud services enable alloydb.googleapis.com \\\n",

For example you can open port 8081 on the VM using firewall rules in the VPC or create a load balancer with public IP. Here we are going to use a SSH tunnel to the VM translating the local port 8081 to the VM port 8081. Open another Cloud Shell tab using the sign \"+\" at the top. In the new cloud shell tab start the tunnel to your VM by executing the gcloud command: gcloud compute ssh instance-1 --zone=us-central1-a -- -NL 8080:localhost:8081 It will show an error \"Cannot assign requested address\" - please ignore it.

You should be able to see the \"Cymbal Air Customer Service Assistant\" page and you can post your question to the assistant at the bottom of the page. This demo showcases the Cymbal Air customer service assistant. Cymbal Air is a fictional passenger airline. The assistant is an AI chatbot that helps travelers to manage flights and look up information about Cymbal Air's hub at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). It can help answer users questions like: When is the next flight to Denver? Are there any luxury shops around gate D50? Where can I get coffee near gate A6? Where can I buy a gift? The application uses the latest Google foundation models to generate responses and augment it by information about flights and amenities from the operational AlloyDB database. You can read more about this demo application on the Github page of the project. 9.
